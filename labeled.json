I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).I have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00. I look forward to hearing from you.Greg  - Draw # 1 - 10.25.01.xls ",

I also don't think it makes sense to attack the large companies that have the DWR contracts. We generally end up working together on various issues and I do n't want to damage the relationships. I agree with many of the points John makes, but I don't want to be identified with the letter.Enron Wind also needs to see an Edison MOU bill passed so we can get paid our past due amounts and get our five year fixed energy price on our ISO4 contracts. I plan to be in Sacramento the next couple of days and will stop by Governmental Advocates.Regards,Hap",

Apparently, word is on the street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the \"misconduct\" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the \"unnamed\" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it.\"  No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed \"Czar\" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also set up the Governing Boards.",

They made the following points:The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but==20they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=,=20a big part of the problem is a \"dysfunctional market\" -- a thinly veiled=20reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20customers and generators) must \"behave responsibly\".Everyone must \"share the pain\".The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=ve=20proposals in the next couple of weeks.While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the==20attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was==20fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of==20new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments==20about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=on=20siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The=20staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=t=20remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=nd=20remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=te=20(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =is=20a \"share the pain\" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=e=20deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=rm=20of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either==20agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis==20administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the==20problem. =20I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as==20always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should=20prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)==20that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar=d=20(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps==20them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already=20articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the==20political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.

            "Text": "Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. \"The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,\" but the \"precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,\" warned Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC \"should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action.\" Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the \"extraordinary regulatory treatment\" that the Commission gave it. Critics claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. \"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in California this summer,\" Breathitt said. If anything, she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is. There should have been a \"fuller airing of this issue\" at FERC before the project was certificated, she noted. \"It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more importantly, that they will cause no further harm.\" The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers. \"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines,\" the order said [CP01-106. For starters, \"the record does not show that pro-rata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge.\" Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers, it noted. \"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers,\" the order said. \"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction.\" The project would increase the \"limited-term, incremental transportation capacity\" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project recently went through an open season",

There should have been a \"fuller airing of this issue\" at FERC before the project was certificated, she noted. \"It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more importantly, that they will cause no further harm.\" The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers. \"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines,\" the order said [CP01-106. For starters, \"the record does not show that pro-rata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge.\" Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers, it noted. \"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers,\" the order said. \"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction.\" The project would increase the \"limited-term, incremental transportation capacity\" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects. The 2003 project recently went through an open season",

The turbine market is a worldwide market.  Firms will have difficulty committing their own capital (and borrowing from others) if they propose to put facilities in jurisdisctions where rates are capped or pricing is based on something other than the operation of the market.  Several generators, including Dynegy and Calpine, have said they will look for other homes for the turbines they have ordered.\tJeff Dasovich\t11/17/2000 02:44 PM\t\t Rob:Here's a quick and dirty list of some lessons from California that Alberta may not want to repeat.

The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.Thanks,Jeff",

RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELLTIMES STAFF WRITERS07/28/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionA-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyThe Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants \"may have crossed the line,\" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. \"The governor's approach may be convenient for him,\" said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, \"but it ignores the law.\" Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that \"decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,\" Knox said. \"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing.\" The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of \"a conscious policy of secrecy\" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. \"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks,\" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. \"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer,\" Mead said. \"[He] just said your services are terminated. \"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns.\" Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended \"I don't see a conflict,\" he said. \"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron.\" Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. \"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he wrote. \"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters.\" \"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person.\" However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record.

Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

            "Text": "involved in buying electricity for California from a generator whose stock they owned, setting up a clash of official duties, personal interests.JEFFREY L. RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELLTIMES STAFF WRITERS07/28/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionA-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyThe Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants \"may have crossed the line,\" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. \"The governor's approach may be convenient for him,\" said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, \"but it ignores the law.\" Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that \"decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,\" Knox said. \"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing.\" The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of \"a conscious policy of secrecy\" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. \"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks,\" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. \"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer,\" Mead said. \"[He] just said your services are terminated. \"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns.\" Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended \"I don't see a conflict,\" he said. \"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron.\" Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. \"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he wrote. \"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters.\" \"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person.\" However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects.

To stimulate discussion we proposed that the utility fill 5% of its net short position with 5-year, fixed-price contracts and 5% from 10-year, fixed-price contracts.Everyone on the call liked the proposal.  After some discussion about whether 5%-5% was the right one, Edison agreed to come to Friday's meeting with its proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately.  (Edison may want the number to be higher, and the baskets to be different.)Anything can happen between now and Friday, but thus far looks positive.

Clearly with the new Electricity Order, natural gas is one of the primary factors on electricity prices in California.Our key fear, however small, is that FERC (or someone else) recognizes the huge implication of natural gas prices and seeks to cap natural gas sales for resale of P/L affiliates (such as ENA).  There is some fear that the real monopoly is the holder of LT firm capacity, not the gas production firms.We need to develop a good story as to why the basis gas continues and messaging it quietly into the right FERC staff to keep the pressure of additional Investigations from happening.  Joe is trying to get his hands on the Lukens study presented to the California study Committee on natural gas abuse to help guide our analysis.  Jim",

Thanks so much for arranging it. We'll have a great time--and Cameron and I have already ironed out a nice deal concerning eyeing the Playmates. (I suggest you do the same, Jeff, or are you above gawking at plastic tits?) Jeff and I have our fig leaves all picked out...As far as fetching you at LAX... Because Cameron and I (and PP and Jeff?) are going down on the 30th, we should rent a car then. When Eldon and Nancy come in, we'll already have a car, and so we can just collect you and go right to the hotel. Does that sound okay? That way, you guys won't have to rent a car when you get in. (I'll put Eldon on as a driver so that he can take over behind the wheel, if he wants to do that.) What kind of car should I get? Do we drive to the mansion? Now that I think about it, that would mean we need to squeeze 6 in one car. Anyway, let me know what your thought are on this.Have a great time with the Hopkins. Merry Christmas to PP and Jeff.

You could, I suppose, request to recuse Chairman Wood from this matter, but I don't think that would necessarily be in our interest, and could be politically disadvantageous.  A potentially more appropriate approach might be to request to respond to whatever Kahn told Chairman Wood.The mere fact that Chairman Wood revealed this matter, however, indicates to me that he was not overly sympathetic to Kahn.  Without knowing more as to the precise nature of the conversation, its hard to say, but my initial reaction is that this matter is probably best left to rest.

They did not vote out an order today, but expect to take up this issue again next meeting.  The staff memo recommended the following:For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the \"Supply Margin Assessment\" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  Since the interim measure is only a \"snapshot\" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.  Commissioner Breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement, stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the Commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability.",

It might be better to change them to the operating cash flow number.  If you guys would like, I can recalculate them.I agree that having higher amounts of debt will fend off take overs.Are we planing to calculate the amount the tax shield will increase the value of the company.  If we assume that the debt will be held in perpetuity, we can directly compute the amount.  Let me know and I can run the numbers.Also, Jimmy when you do the color graphs you want to do.

I really liked what you have done.  I did not want to make any direct changes, but rather just pose a few questions for discussion.First, when I calculated how long it would take to purchase the shares without debt I did use the net income number.  It might be better to change them to the operating cash flow number.  If you guys would like, I can recalculate them.I agree that having higher amounts of debt will fend off take overs.Are we planing to calculate the amount the tax shield will increase the value of the company.  If we assume that the debt will be held in perpetuity, we can directly compute the amount.  Let me know and I can run the numbers.Also, Jimmy when you do the color graphs you want to do.  Try some MM pie charts (just kidding)Good job,Let me know what I can do to help.Dylan",

Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?  I think we probably need to limit our role to \"short of litigation\" type stuff.   Maybe \"reasonable efforts, short of litigation\", something like that?That's all for the first quick read.

The changes can be inspected by launching the attachment in Word and then going to Tools --- Track Changes --- Highlight Changes to display and print the changes in the document.A number of questions must be addressed.  They include, in no particular order:Can we delete the confidentiality article?Is it commercially important to restore the langauge on displacement deliveries?What will the compensation arrangements be?Are we willing to deduct the administrative fee from the net cumulative revenues?  [Doing so \"loses\" us $10,000 a month.]Will we collect accounts receivable directly or have payments made to a deposit account in which we will retain a security interest?How should Section 2.9(ii) be recast to allay Boyd's regulatory approval concern?Is the new Section 2.10 acceptable?How must the agreement change to reflect the \"two county\" concern?I look forward to discussing this with you at your convenience.

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read,copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify thesender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system.Thank you._______________________________________________________________Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections isto significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event thatgovernmental action related to the agreement is modified in a mannerunacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can comeat any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involveapproval  \"required\" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did notpropose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement whichrefers to adverse \"rate approval\". However, Peoples' intent may be toobtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decisionre the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of atermination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarilyrequired for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified \"in any mannerwhich is unacceptable\" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with theoriginal language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right tocircumstances when a \"required\" approval is revoked.) While the broadenedtermination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, Iwouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of amodified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agencyarrangement.2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenuedefinition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market HubSerivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, theproposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the termof the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to marketextended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination ofthe Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the lastsentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative netrevenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH'sperspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actuallyrefunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not requirea retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreementterminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would beneeded.3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it makenominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt ordelivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at asecondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. didagree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not knowthe value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC bedefined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC mayelect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peopleseffective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may bemodified from time to time.\" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to proposechanges to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate thatParking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review thisfurther.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified thelanguage giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC toassign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply withrequirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not becertificated as a \"natural gas company\", if there is another entity withclear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act andFERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicatingthat Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensurecompliance with regulatory requirements.          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of thesending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change ininformation re firm capacity. Perhaps \"in its sole discretion\" can bedelted and the last word of the third sentence changed to \"appropriate\".                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list ofgrounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies thegrounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should notadd to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce providedunder the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illinioistariffs have equal scheduling priority.                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places therisk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. Thisis how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. Withthe changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment riskalso may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should followresponsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-paymentrisk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based ona credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to theadministrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refundsfor ten business days. Should there be an interest component?                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. ThisSection suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'mdon't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimizeimbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 areexpected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoplesshould attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them onWed.                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties toindicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with \"material\" contractcs andJudgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is itsuffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with someLaws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did nothave a flat fee component.15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable toboth Peoples and MEH, People should not have \"sole\" authority to prepareand file all applications.                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments abovere Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word\"expressly\" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should theSection require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to havethis requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to beincluded, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to getstarted which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement hada section along these lines.          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.                                                   20. Former 15.1 (f) nowdeleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEHis dissolved. This seems necessary to me.          21. 15.1 (g) Peopleswishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, butproposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a changeimpairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH toterminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a needto demonstrate reasonableness.                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understandwhy Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensationsections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would haveaccess to this information under a protective agreement. This wouldunnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what thereis to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record inthe NIGAS approval case.                                     That's all.Let's discuss tomorrow.",

I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicatingthat Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensurecompliance with regulatory requirements.          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of thesending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change ininformation re firm capacity. Perhaps \"in its sole discretion\" can bedelted and the last word of the third sentence changed to \"appropriate\".                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list ofgrounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies thegrounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should notadd to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce providedunder the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illinioistariffs have equal scheduling priority.                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places therisk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. Thisis how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. Withthe changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment riskalso may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should followresponsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-paymentrisk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based ona credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to theadministrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refundsfor ten business days. Should there be an interest component?                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. ThisSection suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'mdon't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimizeimbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 areexpected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoplesshould attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them onWed.                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties toindicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with \"material\" contractcs andJudgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is itsuffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with someLaws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did nothave a flat fee component.15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable toboth Peoples and MEH, People should not have \"sole\" authority to prepareand file all applications.                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments abovere Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word\"expressly\" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should theSection require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to havethis requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to beincluded, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to getstarted which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement hada section along these lines.          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.                                                   20. Former 15.1 (f) nowdeleted. This provided that the Agency Agreement could be terminated is MEHis dissolved. This seems necessary to me.          21. 15.1 (g) Peopleswishes to have sole discretion to change its Facilities or the GTC, butproposes to limit MEH's termination right in the event that such a changeimpairs the HUB's marketability. It seems reasonably to allow MEH toterminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a needto demonstrate reasonableness.                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understandwhy Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensationsections. The Illinois Commission Staff and interested parties would haveaccess to this information under a protective agreement. This wouldunnecessarily complicate the approval process and I don't know what thereis to gain from secrecy. These provisions were part of the public record inthe NIGAS approval case.                                     That's all.Let's discuss tomorrow.",

All dogs go through adjustments.  She may be trying to find out who is the boss.  There are lots of little tricks I can tell you about to show her you are the boss.  I'll try to make you a list while you are gone.  CRATE TRAIN HER!!  It is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself.  She may fuss at first, but she will love it. Crating her will calm her down. I believe the Pointer Rescue people agree.  ckmI think I'll try the treat approach and see if that helps.  I scold her and then tell her I love her and pet and kiss her and she pops right back.  She's not a dumb dog, just a stubborn dog!I'm not feeling very good again today, probably lack of sleep!  She was looking pretty drowsy herself this morning too, she didn't get her 10 hours of sleep.  I bet the neighbors are just loving us.  Oh well!I'll print this out now.  How many of those pigs ears can I give her at night.  We feed her in the morning and she's hungry again at night.  Although dogs are pigs and always want more.

            "Text": "Several discussions have been circulating regarding current Enron phone numbers and the need for new toll-free numbers the UBS East Power Group.For the UBS Power Trading group (EAST):  We can request new toll-free numbers (24 Hour, Fax and Scheduling) as per Kathy Link (UBS Houston 5-5418).  \ta. \tDon Baughman and I have discussed a few options for these numbers, but would welcome any input or related requirements you may be \t\t\t\taware of prior to us initiating this.\tb.\tWe will establish these for East Power ASAP.   David Steiner (503-464-3701) will be the contact to facilitate this effort for the West Desk   \t   Our current \"853\" numbers will probably be replaced by new \"584\" numbers(Kathy Link is working on this).  If this occurs, new numbers will be assigned to us.   Our Current \"800\" numbers for 24-Hour, \"Fax, and Scheduling can be forwarded  / transferred by the IT group to the Estate from our current phone turrets.Let's discuss these numbers tomorrow, Tuesday morning (February 4th).Thanks,Corry Bentley3-0421",

Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.Thank you.",

            "Text": "Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =of significant events that led to our current situation:-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=r imagined when we made these investments;-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=stand financial and operating disclosures; and-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=usly reported earnings.We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=Core BusinessesOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=ese include:-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=.I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=mprovement in our counterparty relationships.Non-Core BusinessesOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal.We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.Businesses Under ReviewThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=ecomes available.Credit Rating/10-Q FilingWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:-- Moody's at Baa3       \"Under Review for Further Downgrade\"-- Fitch at BBB-             \"Evolving Status\"-- S&P at BBB-              \"CreditWatch Negative\"We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin= and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =19.We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=stors under \"SEC Filings.\"=20=20In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=n. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint pro=xy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes= available, because it will contain important information. Investors and se=curity holders may obtain a free copy of the joint proxy statement/prospect=us (when it is available) and other documents containing information about =Dynegy and Enron, without charge, at the SEC's web site at www.sec.gov.

Guess that makes sense, too.You want to coordinate on when to get there? That may be too out of character for all of us, but we can aspire to organization.It is hot here, too.  The wind in the afternoon is really oppressive.  Dry heat - HA!  It is still darn hot.I cringe at the thought of Six Flags.  I'm sure Paige can be bought.  She went recently and had a big time.Hope your week is quiet.Love/hugs, etc, to all,Kay\"Lisa Clarke\" <lisa@casa-de-clarke.com> on 07/16/2000 09:54:56 PMHi!We are back from Six Flags. I don't know what it is about us, but we alwaysseem to end up in Theme Parks when the temperature is over 103. We call thatCrowd Bustin' Temps! We had a great time and we are completely exhausted.The girls are getting ready for bed without even complaining. It was fun togo, but if I were you I would hire Paige to take Michael there! It haschanged since we were kids, but it is really a teenage heaven -- I thinkthere are like 8 HUGE roller coasters. Did you know that it isn't fungetting nauseated anymore?? Pink Things still taste great and the GunslingerShow is still funny!We didn't really see much of mom and dad until today. It was nice chattingwith them. I can tell that Mama is getting a little bit of cabin fever.Tomorrow she starts her exercise class and she's going out for lunch. When Icalled her when we got home she said that Daddy's leg was feeling muchbetter. I could tell that the knee incident on Friday really upset themboth. I think they were afraid that it wouldn't get better. But, it seemslike it is better now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.Mother is really looking forward to the surprise birthday. We gave dad acopy of the movie My Dog Skip for his present while we were there, completewith his birthday card. (Just to muddy the water a bit!)Now, let me see if I can remember the things Mama wanted me to tell you. Iknow that she wanted me to tell you that she won't be able to stock up onsoft drinks, juice or other things like that since it would make Daddysuspicious. I'll probably bring Pop Tarts for the kids breakfast on Sunday.Plus drinks and juice.  Also, do you know if we will be having birthday cakefor desert? If not, let me know and I can always bring one. I'll bring Budand wine and kid drinks. Anything else?I can't believe we were able to go and visit and not spill the beans. That'spretty good for us!I wish we were still on \"vacation\", but I guess you have to come back to thereal world sometime. When we got home we had phone messages from Bobby'ssister and aunt and a note from his dad. I think I'll wait and talk to themtomorrow. They take a lot of energy you know!Tell your family hello for me. We are all looking forward to seeing you guysat the pink house!Love you!Lisa",

I'm too old to go out on a school night!Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the blockage.  When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled.  Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.  Sounds dangerous to me, but I don't really know anything about it.Too bad about Katie's asthma.  I was worried that Paige has it, but she went through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.  Just really bad allergies that make her wheeze.  I'm not sure of the difference, but I believe this dr.Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.  We asked this spring and he said not yet.  I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't want to push him either.  Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids play.  Maybe we can come watch Annie play.Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week. Everything else is business as usual around here.  Say \"hey\" to everyone.Love,Kay",
