They made the following points:The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but==20they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=,=20a big part of the problem is a \"dysfunctional market\" -- a thinly veiled=20reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20customers and generators) must \"behave responsibly\".Everyone must \"share the pain\".The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=ve=20proposals in the next couple of weeks.While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the==20attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was==20fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of==20new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments==20about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=on=20siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The=20staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=t=20remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=nd=20remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=te=20(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =is=20a \"share the pain\" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=e=20deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=rm=20of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either==20agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis==20administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the==20problem. =20I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as==20always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.

In other words, we have already=20articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the==20political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.

RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELLTIMES STAFF WRITERS07/28/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionA-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyThe Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants \"may have crossed the line,\" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. \"The governor's approach may be convenient for him,\" said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, \"but it ignores the law.\" Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that \"decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,\" Knox said. \"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing.\" The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of \"a conscious policy of secrecy\" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. \"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks,\" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. \"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer,\" Mead said. \"[He] just said your services are terminated. \"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns.\" Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended \"I don't see a conflict,\" he said. \"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron.\" Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. \"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he wrote. \"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters.\" \"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person.\" However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. \"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks,\" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. \"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer,\" Mead said. \"[He] just said your services are terminated. \"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns.\" Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended \"I don't see a conflict,\" he said. \"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron.\" Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. \"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he wrote. \"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters.\" \"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person.\" However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELLTIMES STAFF WRITERS07/28/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionA-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyThe Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants \"may have crossed the line,\" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. \"The governor's approach may be convenient for him,\" said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, \"but it ignores the law.\" Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that \"decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,\" Knox said. \"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing.\" The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of \"a conscious policy of secrecy\" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts.

Clearly with the new Electricity Order, natural gas is one of the primary factors on electricity prices in California.Our key fear, however small, is that FERC (or someone else) recognizes the huge implication of natural gas prices and seeks to cap natural gas sales for resale of P/L affiliates (such as ENA).  There is some fear that the real monopoly is the holder of LT firm capacity, not the gas production firms.We need to develop a good story as to why the basis gas continues and messaging it quietly into the right FERC staff to keep the pressure of additional Investigations from happening.

(I'll put Eldon on as a driver so that he can take over behind the wheel, if he wants to do that.) What kind of car should I get? Do we drive to the mansion?

They did not vote out an order today, but expect to take up this issue again next meeting.  The staff memo recommended the following:For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the \"Supply Margin Assessment\" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  Since the interim measure is only a \"snapshot\" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read,copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify thesender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system.Thank you._______________________________________________________________Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections isto significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event thatgovernmental action related to the agreement is modified in a mannerunacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can comeat any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involveapproval  \"required\" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did notpropose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement whichrefers to adverse \"rate approval\". However, Peoples' intent may be toobtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decisionre the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of atermination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarilyrequired for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified \"in any mannerwhich is unacceptable\" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with theoriginal language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right tocircumstances when a \"required\" approval is revoked.) While the broadenedtermination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, Iwouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of amodified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agencyarrangement.2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenuedefinition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market HubSerivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, theproposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the termof the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to marketextended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination ofthe Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the lastsentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative netrevenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH'sperspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actuallyrefunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not requirea retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreementterminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would beneeded.3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it makenominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt ordelivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at asecondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. didagree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not knowthe value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC bedefined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC mayelect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peopleseffective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may bemodified from time to time.\" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to proposechanges to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate thatParking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review thisfurther.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified thelanguage giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC toassign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply withrequirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not becertificated as a \"natural gas company\", if there is another entity withclear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act andFERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicatingthat Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensurecompliance with regulatory requirements.          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of thesending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change ininformation re firm capacity. Perhaps \"in its sole discretion\" can bedelted and the last word of the third sentence changed to \"appropriate\".                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list ofgrounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies thegrounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should notadd to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce providedunder the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illinioistariffs have equal scheduling priority.                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places therisk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. Thisis how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. Withthe changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment riskalso may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should followresponsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-paymentrisk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based ona credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to theadministrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refundsfor ten business days. Should there be an interest component?                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. ThisSection suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'mdon't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimizeimbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 areexpected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoplesshould attempt to use these procedures.

If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read,copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify thesender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system.Thank you._______________________________________________________________Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections isto significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event thatgovernmental action related to the agreement is modified in a mannerunacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can comeat any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involveapproval  \"required\" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did notpropose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement whichrefers to adverse \"rate approval\". However, Peoples' intent may be toobtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decisionre the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of atermination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarilyrequired for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified \"in any mannerwhich is unacceptable\" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with theoriginal language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right tocircumstances when a \"required\" approval is revoked.) While the broadenedtermination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, Iwouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of amodified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agencyarrangement.2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenuedefinition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market HubSerivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, theproposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the termof the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to marketextended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination ofthe Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the lastsentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative netrevenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH'sperspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actuallyrefunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not requirea retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreementterminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would beneeded.3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it makenominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt ordelivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at asecondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. didagree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not knowthe value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC bedefined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC mayelect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peopleseffective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may bemodified from time to time.\" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to proposechanges to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate thatParking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review thisfurther.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified thelanguage giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC toassign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply withrequirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not becertificated as a \"natural gas company\", if there is another entity withclear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act andFERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicatingthat Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensurecompliance with regulatory requirements.          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of thesending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change ininformation re firm capacity. Perhaps \"in its sole discretion\" can bedelted and the last word of the third sentence changed to \"appropriate\".                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list ofgrounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies thegrounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should notadd to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce providedunder the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illinioistariffs have equal scheduling priority.                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places therisk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. Thisis how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. Withthe changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment riskalso may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should followresponsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-paymentrisk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based ona credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to theadministrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refundsfor ten business days. Should there be an interest component?                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. ThisSection suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'mdon't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimizeimbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 areexpected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoplesshould attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them onWed.                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties toindicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with \"material\" contractcs andJudgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect.

She may be trying to find out who is the boss.  There are lots of little tricks I can tell you about to show her you are the boss.  I'll try to make you a list while you are gone.  CRATE TRAIN HER!!  It is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself.  She may fuss at first, but she will love it. Crating her will calm her down. I believe the Pointer Rescue people agree.  ckmI think I'll try the treat approach and see if that helps.  I scold her and then tell her I love her and pet and kiss her and she pops right back.  She's not a dumb dog, just a stubborn dog!I'm not feeling very good again today, probably lack of sleep!  She was looking pretty drowsy herself this morning too, she didn't get her 10 hours of sleep.  I bet the neighbors are just loving us.  Oh well!I'll print this out now.  How many of those pigs ears can I give her at night.  We feed her in the morning and she's hungry again at night.  Although dogs are pigs and always want more.

The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.Thank you.", "Conflict": true, "Professional": true, "Tone": true, "Conflict Words %": 0.10954063604240283, "Friendly Words %": 0.10600706713780919, "Sentiment": 0.38325892857142857, "Subject Sentiment": 0.0, "Punctuation %": 0.01814646791963707}], "thread108": [{"conflict": "yes", "professional": "yes", "tone": "stern"}, {"Timestamp": "Wed, 14 Nov 2001 19:26:42 -0800 (PST)", "Sender": "chairman.ken@enron.com", "Recipient": "dl-ga-all_enron_worldwide1@enron", "Subject": "Overview of Investor Conference Call", "Text": "Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =of significant events that led to our current situation:-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=r imagined when we made these investments;-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=stand financial and operating disclosures; and-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=usly reported earnings.We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=Core BusinessesOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=ese include:-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=.I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=mprovement in our counterparty relationships.Non-Core BusinessesOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal.We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.Businesses Under ReviewThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=ecomes available.Credit Rating/10-Q FilingWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:-- Moody's at Baa3       \"Under Review for Further Downgrade\"-- Fitch at BBB-             \"Evolving Status\"-- S&P at BBB-              \"CreditWatch Negative\"We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin= and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =19.We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=ll as our frequent updates with you.

I'm too old to go out on a school night!Mom said that the dr wants to do a sonogram on Dad's neck to check out the blockage.  When I talked to her they didn't know when it would be scheduled.  Evidently there is some unclogging procedure they can do.  Sounds dangerous to me, but I don't really know anything about it.Too bad about Katie's asthma.  I was worried that Paige has it, but she went through a bunch of tests and they said she doesn't have it.  Just really bad allergies that make her wheeze.  I'm not sure of the difference, but I believe this dr.Michael still isn't interested in playing team sports.  We asked this spring and he said not yet.  I don't know why he doesn't want to play, but I don't want to push him either.  Maybe I should take him to watch some little kids play.  Maybe we can come watch Annie play.Neil's rodeo stuff will be over next week. Everything else is business as usual around here.

Any thoughts on this prior to Monday would be appreciated.Regards,Ben ", "Conflict": true, "Professional": true, "Tone": true, "Conflict Words %": 0.041379310344827586, "Friendly Words %": 0.0896551724137931, "Sentiment": 0.11875, "Subject Sentiment": 0.0, "Punctuation %": 0.08860759493670886}, {"Timestamp": "Thu, 12 Apr 2001 11:28:00 -0700 (PDT)", "Sender": "kay.mann@enron.com", "Recipient": "roseann", "Subject": "Northwestern", "Text": "Here's the electronic file.", "Conflict": true, "Professional": true, "Tone": true, "Conflict Words %": 0.0, "Friendly Words %": 0.0, "Subject Sentiment": 0.0, "Punctuation %": 0.07407407407407407}, {"Timestamp": "Mon, 16 Apr 2001 11:11:00 -0700 (PDT)", "Sender": "kay.mann@enron.com", "Recipient": "mreuter@kslaw", "Subject": "Northwestern", "Text": "Hi there,I am meeting with Ben tomorrow to discuss NWestern.

After reviewing your presentation,here are some tough questions that we can discuss tomorrow:1.    Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained undercontracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energyreplaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committedQF power with short-term firm energy?2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which ithas substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with marketenergy from sources over which it may have less control?3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available inCalifornia, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steepis the supply curve for replacement energy?4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in theelectric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provideon-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changesin the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QFcontract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, whenthe same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such asthe QF buyouts done to date)?7.

This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?

The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April 30, 2002, for the price cap, which first went into effect in July of last year. However, FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of 2002. The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time. Therefore, FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running. \"We believe that our decision ... will promote price certainty and market participants' confidence in the New York ISO-administered markets, which will increase supply, improve reliability and ... lower energy prices,\" the agency said in its order. The New York ISO operates one of the nation's biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions. The $1,000 price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices. The cap is supported by several large utilities, such as Consolidated Edison Inc. , which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the state's power grid. FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nation's power grid. Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter, in which the antiquated U.S. grid prevented more power from flowing into the state. Under FERC's plan, the RTOs would be for-profit groups in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access, more reliable power and lower rates for consumers. However, some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines. USING scare and bully tactics, the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control. That's the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nation's electric grid. The efficient, stable, economical PJM Interconnection grid system that's taken over 70 years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of high-cost New York. Maryland's carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years. Challenges by Maryland, Virginia and Washington to the federal agency's mandate have been ignored. So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire. Curiously, FERC cited the PJM network, which includes Maryland, as a model for the nation. Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems. Warning of California -type energy problems for the rest of the nation, FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better. It ignores the fact that California is the largest U.S. electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement. Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems. States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them. Even within PJM, which serves five states and Washington, members hold differing positions on forming mega-regional networks. But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its 22 million customers well. There's little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners. Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.

The report, which covered October 2001 through May 2002, projected that resources would cover expected load each month with the exception of May, when demand rises significantly as the region starts to heat up. \"Operating margins for May 2002 are slim with the current level of planned outages. However, the May peak generally occurs late in the month and planned outage levels usually decline significantly throughout the month,\" the report noted. The report also said that new generation should play a key role in helping to avert blackouts in May. \"It is expected that sufficient new generation will become available such that the projected deficiency for May 2002 can be avoided,\" the report said. An additional 1,612 megawatts is expected to be operational by the end of 2001. During 2002, an additional 6,490 MW of new generation capacity is expected to be added based on currently announced plans. \"This additional generation is in varying phases of development and it is uncertain how much of this new capacity will become available during the January through May 2002 period,\" the report said. Forecast peak load was seen mostly running slightly below an average covering 1998-2001. In December, for example, a peak load of 33,586 MW was projected versus an average of 33,937 MW, ISO figures show. Demand has been running below year earlier levels each month this year. \"The CAISO foresees that there will be some lasting effects due to conservation efforts, but anticipates that the magnitude of conservation may decrease over time,\" the report said. California, hit with a severe power shortage linked partly to a flawed law deregulating its electricity market, endured the year's sixth and so far last rolling blackout on May 8. The lights stayed on throughout the summer, when the threat of blackouts was seen to be greatest due to heavy use of power hungry air conditioning systems. Conservation and new power plants are believed to have played important roles in preventing blackouts.  Texas Ready For Jan 1 Start For Deregulation -Official  CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Texas will be ready to implement full-scale deregulation of the retail electricity business at the beginning of next year, despite challenges from critics, the top official at the state's power-grid operator said Monday . \"We believe that we've come a long way,\" said Tom Noel, chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. \"My confidence is very high that the Ercot system will be ready to go Jan. 1, 2002.\" A coalition of Texas consumer groups filed with the state's Public Utility Commission last week to urge a delay. A pilot program for 5% of Texas' investor-owned utility customers has been in effect since late July, and it started after a nearly two-month delay linked to system glitches. The consumer groups, including AARP and Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports, want to delay the start of full competition until Ercot proves its systems are up to the task. The groups cited problems with switching customers from their utility to alternate suppliers, among other issues. \"It is in the best interests of consumers and the industry to be sure that when the market is open it is also functional,\" the groups said in comments filed with the PSC. But Noel said most glitches have been fixed or will be fixed in time to meet the Jan. 1 deadline. So far 11,952 of 78,825 customers that requested a switch to a new provider have been switched, and the others are moving through the planned 45-day switching process, he said. There was a backlog of customers waiting to switch in August, caused by system malfunctions, but those have mostly been resolved, he said. Ercot has had other trouble making sure its system gets customer information to the new power supplier, but it believes those systems will be fixed by mid November, Noel said. Noel also said Ercot's settlement system will become more accurate over time as more data is collected to provide better cost estimates. The settlement system calculates costs for large and small wholesale power customers and has been a source of dispute in the state. \"The market's working very well,\" Noel said. \"What we have is a data problem.\" Ercot's systems are designed to handle about 20,000 customer switches a day. So far, the system has received and processed a peak volume of between 10,000 and 15,000 switches, Noel said. -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com  Calif Will Have Enough Power On Hand This Winter -Report LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California may be able to chill out a bit this winter. New power plants and continued conservation should give the state enough of a margin to head off the soaring prices and rolling blackouts that plagued it a year ago, according to a forecast released last week by the state's power grid operator \"In general, it looks like a pretty good forecast through the winter months into 2002,\" said Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the California Independent System Operator. Last winter, California experienced an unprecedented electricity shortage that resulted in more than 30 days of power emergencies and scattered rolling blackouts. The situation was partly due to the deteriorating financial condition of the state's two largest utilities, high prices of natural gas and maintenance outages. This winter, however, the state should have an adequate supply of electricity , due in part to new generation coming online and a statewide conservation effort. Power-plant maintenance will be minimal during the 2001-2002 winter season compared with last year, and new power plants operating since Sept. 30 will produce 2,231 megawatts in new supply, according to the ISO report. The ISO, charged with keeping power supply and demand in balance on the grid and operating the state's spot electricity market, expects demand for power to peak at 34,359 megawatts in October and about 32,000 megawatts from November through May. That would leave operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 megawatts - roughly a 7% reserve margin - the minimum amount required by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, which maintains grid reliability throughout the West. The ISO said the reserve margin is enough to avert the disaster the state experienced last winter, according to the report. In addition, the ISO expects there will be enough natural gas in storage to meet demand. Last winter, the price of natural gas skyrocketed to $60 a million British thermal unit. Currently, the average price of natural gas is about $2/MMBtu. \"Natural-gas storage is looking very, very strong,\" Fishman said. \"There's far more in storage and available in general than we saw last year at this same time.\" The ISO doesn't know whether generators have firm fuel contracts in place to cover demand. But the grid operator doesn't expect limits on gas supplies to hurt its ability to keep the lights on, according to the report. The ISO forecast assumes Californians will continue to conserve about 12% of their electrical consumption, Fishman said. The state also relies heavily on imports from the Pacific Northwest in order to get through without any power emergencies or rolling blackouts. The state expects to import about 3,000 MW this winter. As a result, the ISO forecast could change in the coming months, if the state is unable to import power. Currently, the forecast for the Pacific Northwest calls for a wet winter in the Northwest, according to the National Weather Service. Jerry Rust, president of the Northwest Power Pool, told Dow Jones Newswires the region expects to cover peak demand this winter. The agency is currently preparing its own report, he added. New generation upgrades in northern California will help minimize congestion on the transmission link known as Path 15, the key north-south interconnection, although bottlenecks could still occur, according to the report. \"Depending on actual Pacific Northwest import levels and Northern California hydro levels, potential overloads on Path 15 could occur again this winter as a result of south-to-north power transfers,\" according to the report. Some areas of northern California , particularly Humboldt County and the Bay Area, could encounter some difficulties if local generation isn't available due to power plant maintenance or breakdowns. For 2002, the ISO said there are 40 new power plant projects totaling 6,490 megawatts that are in different phases of hooking up to the grid, but it's unclear how much of that capacity will be added before May 2002, according to the report.   CPUC Approves Transmission Project SAN FRANCISCO, California - The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) last week approved a transmission project to increase capacity to several cities in the San Francisco metropolitan area, that will be built by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). The 230-kilovolt transmission line would serve the cities of Dublin, Pleasanton, Livermore, San Ramon, and unincorporated areas of Alameda and Contra Costa counties. The CPUC placed a cap of $118 million on the project costs for the 8.8-mile line. As a condition for approval, the CPUC also required PG&E to remove an existing 60-kilovolt line.   WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2001--A broad group of electric transmission line owners in the Southwest has taken initial steps to form WestConnect, a for-profit regional transmission organization (RTO). Founding members believe WestConnect will form the framework for an RTO for the entire Western United States. Agreements and operating protocols for the RTO were filed today with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by Arizona Public Service Co., El Paso Electric Co., Public Service Co. of New Mexico, and Tucson Electric Power Co., each of which is subject to FERC oversight. These utilities, along with Salt River Project in Arizona, have agreed to fund start-up of WestConnect operations, which are projected to begin in 2004. Other utilities in the Desert Southwest and adjoining areas have been actively involved in the process and are expected to continue to be involved as WestConnect gets underway. FERC has proposed RTOs to facilitate development and operation of transmission on a regional basis. WestConnect will strengthen reliability for customers and ease the transfer of electricity between regions. It will do so by focusing on transmission line reliability, non-discriminatory open access to use of the lines, support for a robust wholesale market, and governance that is independent of market participants. WestConnect evolved from an earlier Southwestern RTO development project named DesertSTAR, and it has used the operating protocols developed by DesertSTAR stakeholders through extensive negotiations during the last four years. DesertSTAR Chairman of the Board Jack King said, \"WestConnect is a logical step. I am encouraged by the actions of the WestConnect members in building upon the work of DesertSTAR to move toward an RTO for the West.\" The group turned to the for-profit governance structure, in lieu of the not-for-profit DesertSTAR model, in response to recent FERC rulings and a desire to create a governance structure that will encourage innovation and creativity in the operation and further development of the Western transmission grid. WestConnect has been structured to permit involvement by investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, public-power entities and federal power marketing agencies, so it can transition into the RTO for the West. WestConnect is working closely with other utility companies and provisional RTO projects to explore expanding WestConnect's service area. WestConnect utilities say they are confident their filing with FERC conforms to the regulatory agency's established organizational and operating guidelines.

I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC \"overpayment\".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC \"overpayment\"?  On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the \"overpayment\" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.Jim -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 7:24 PMTo:\tSteffes, James D.After 3/31/02, the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit, no?  So a customer's CTC payments should not be affected by refunds. If refunds are distributed prospectively, we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PG&E's expected refunds, divide it by total load, and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount.  This is more akin to a lower shopping credit than a higher CTC. -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 4:32 PMTo:\tComnes, AlanAlan --The only way to collect the \"overpayment\" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.Jim -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 6:15 PMTo:\tSteffes, James D.I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.

I fully agree on BF costs and DWR costs.  I believe that you are right on Est RT$ = CAISOM Imbalance, but I need to check.On the question of retroactive ratemaking, it is my understanding that you are correct.  PG&E probably won't rebill, but will need to put in place an adjustment to the going forward PX Credit to \"collect\" the overpayment of Negative CTC.All of this means that the impact of the FERC refund is less than 100c on the $ for the Negative CTC.Jim -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 4:35 PMTo:\tSteffes, James D.; Dasovich, Jeff; Tribolet, Michael; Curry, Wanda; Mellencamp, Lisa; 'Jan Paul Acton (E-mail)'; Swain, Steve; Mara, SusanCc:\tAlvarez, RayI assume that if an hourly PX market clearing price is mitigated per a FERC order it would affect variable \"HC\" in the formula laid out in the attachment.It is not clear to me which  variable represents hourly ISO imbalance energy costs, but I assume its \"Est RT$\".  If I am right, that variable would be affected by  the mitigated market price (MMP) for CAISO imbalance energy.My comments are:The FERC is able to only order refunds to jurisdictional entities and, given appeals, it may take years before the full extent of thre refunds are known.  Therefore there will be a significant difference between the change in the mitigated market price (MMP) as declared by FERC and the PX credit.  That is, a 10% reduction in the MMP should not be construed as having a 10% effect on the PX credit, assuming it can be recalculated at all.  Specifically, only some of the \"HC\" or  \"Est RT$\"  costs can  be adjusted per FERC refund orders.Also, the PX credit is a tariffed rate.  I do not believe the PU code allows for retroactive adjustments to tariffed rates unless there was an explicit cost tracking account (e.g. a balancing A/C).  To my knowledge, no such account exists here.  Finally, I do not see a relationship between MMPs and (1) block forward costs on any date and (2) PG&E and/or DWR's procurement costs for the net short position post January 19.  So, those PX credit costs should be unaffected by any FERC refund order.Alan Comnes -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 7:22 AMTo:\tDasovich, Jeff; Tribolet, Michael; Curry, Wanda; Mellencamp, Lisa; Jan Paul Acton (E-mail); Swain, Steve; Mara, Susan; Comnes, AlanSubject:\tPG&E PX Credit Calculation Attached is a summary of PG&E's notes on how they calculate the PX Credit (until January 19, 2001 when they hardwired $150/mwh).

Gray Davis has started taking money from power providers seeking to do business with the state. The two $25,000 contributions came during a series of fund-raisers the governor held when he made a trip last month to the East Coast to view the damage at the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The Democratic governor, who has raised more than $30 million for his re- election campaign, has been criticized for taking money from groups that have interests before the administration. Yesterday, Davis defended the decision to take the money, saying the worst of the energy crisis is behind us. \"My concern was in not taking money from people who were actively selling us power during the difficult early months in 2001,\" he said of his decision in January to stop taking contributions from utilities and power companies. \"To my knowledge neither of those companies are active players in that process. \" But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield blasted Davis for accepting the money and said it should be returned. \"If it was dirty money before, it is even dirtier now,\" said Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Davis is mistaken to think that the energy crisis is over, Rosenfield said. \"Tell that to the 20 million Californians who have seen their rates increase an average of 50 percent,\" he said. The two companies -- FPL Energy LLC and Caithness Energy LLC -- each gave $25,000 to Davis' campaign fund. Both contributors have proposed projects pending in California. Caithness Energy, a New York-based generator, is expected to file plans to build a power plant with the California Energy Commission later this month. The company wants to build a 560-megawatt natural gas fired plant in Riverside County. And subsidiaries of FPL Energy, a Florida generator that operates power plants across the country, are in negotiations with the state's new Power Authority to construct wind turbines in Southern California. The state would buy energy from the turbines and have the option to own them. In addition, Caithness and FPL are working together to building another power plant in Riverside County. That project was approved by the state's Energy Commission in March. Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said the campaign's position had not changed with regard to collecting money from energy interests. South said that the two companies had not been gouging the state and that the fact they had business pending with the state was irrelevant. \"It is not against the law to take money from a company that does business with the state,\" he said. South said the contributions had no bearing on any decisions made.   India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in India's 2,184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project next week, A.K. Doda, executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires Friday. The possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) \"After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and thereafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place,\" Doda said. U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC. \"The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties, through mutual negotiations. Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest,\" Doda said. Doda denied local media reports saying that India's state-owned firm National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol. \"So far, I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven't sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project,\" he said. Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation The planned deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an open North American power market. The plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe. David Lindsay, the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser, confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration. \"We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this one,\" he said yesterday. He would not provide details, though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership structure by the conclusion of the year. A senior official in the Ontario government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal \"is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro.\" He was referring to the debt-laden utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans 30,000 kilometres. The Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that \"there are a number of options on the table.\" Sources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion through the sale of bonds to investors. The dealers' commission on the sale of the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said. Mr. Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government to help pay down the $21-billion in \"stranded debt\" racked up by the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province's balance sheet. Hydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders. Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring. The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange. The third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option, though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eventually become a commercial enterprise. Sources said that Hydro One management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive advantage. It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options. Rod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president, would not comment on the not-for-profit option being contemplated by the government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market. \"Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,\" he said in a phone interview. Stanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro One's strategic business plan). In a three-page letter sent this week to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said that \"this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario.\" He argued that \"the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers.\" He also said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to invest in \"new bottleneck-eliminating connections\" that would allow the company to become a significant electricity exporter. \"Ontario would lose the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,\" he said. In a recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote, \"With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United States, where ownership tends to be fragmented.\" He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has \"the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive high-growth initiatives.\" According to sources familiar with the not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers. Restructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the most efficient way to capitalize the company. \"The problem with a Canadian National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,\" said one financier familiar with the proposal. \"With a debt-based structure, every dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments.\" Dofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year. \"We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,\" Mr. Forstner said. \"Until that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontario's boundaries.\" Hydro One at a glance Ontario's electricity transmission system split off from the former Ontario Hydro in May, 2000. It is the largest power distribution network in Canada and serves 1.2 million people.

Pushing for public power / Backers say they'll have issue on next ballotPublic power advocates in San Francisco will have to convince people like Tim Colen that their idea is a good one if they want to go back to the ballot next year and win. Colen, who lives in the West Portal area, voted against two measures on the Nov. 6 ballot that would have paved the way for a public power system in San Francisco and ended PG&E's monopoly in the local energy market. The company and other corporate interests spent more than $2 million to defeat the effort. Colen's vote reflected the sentiment throughout the city's conservative strongholds -- among them West Portal and other West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods -- and in the wealthier pockets of Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff. In those neighborhoods, Proposition F and Measure I lost almost 2 to 1. In the city's more liberal neighborhoods -- Haight-Ashbury, Bernal Heights, South of Market and Noe Valley -- the reverse was true. And in the Mission, support for public power was almost 3 to 1. \"Those were the districts that were focused on because of limited resources,\" said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, a public power booster. \"Once we engaged people, talked to them, they were very responsive. I think the same thing would have to happen in the other districts when we go forward again.\" For Colen, an environmental geologist and consultant, the proposals were poorly drafted, more intent to take a whack at the corporate giant PG&E than to make sure that electricity is delivered to city residents and businesses at a lower cost and more reliably -- as backers of the measures promised. \"San Francisco can get into the energy business,\" said Colen. \"But it should be incremental, with a sound policy, and with people in charge who are experts.\" In addition, he doesn't want an elected board running the operation, as both Measure I and Proposition F required, and he wants the city to explore working with PG&E instead of ousting the private utility competely. Then, Colen said, he may support public power. Proposition F called for replacing the city's existing water and power department with a new, expanded agency to deliver publicly owned electricity to consumers. It lost by 533 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. Measure I, the more far-reaching of the two, lost by 4,361 votes, or 3.5 percentage points. It would have set up a municipal utilities district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane. It made a target of PG&E but also had the power to take over the garbage, cable and phone operations. Despite the loss, supporters of municipal power expect to resurrect the idea. Ammiano and other backers are exploring how far the city can go to begin public power without voter approval. At the same time, they are considering a way to put the issue before voters again next year. Bob Lipman, a retiree who lives in Cow Hollow, voted against the two ballot proposals two weeks ago. His chief concern was the lack of documentation detailing the cost of creating a new public power system. \"It was a blank check,\" he said. He also wanted more than a promise that rates would go down. Supervisor Tony Hall, the West of Twin Peaks representative who opposed the ballot measures, agreed that with more hard facts his constituents might buy into public power if the findings tilted in favor of sound fiscal policy. \"People want to know how much this is going to cost,\" Hall said. Ammiano, the author of Proposition F, said he expected the city to conduct feasibility studies that outline costs, generation capabilities, financing options and the benefits and disadvantages of various public power scenarios. \"While I believe we made a strong case for a municipal water and power agency, I think we can take the time between now and next November to provide further study on the issue, explain to voters exactly why public power will work in San Francisco and expand the coalition to include consumer interests, business owners and property owners backing the idea,\" Ammiano said. Another factor, he said, is voter turnout. \"If we had 1 percent higher turnout we probably would have won,\" Ammiano said. For example, several neighborhoods -- among them the Western Addition, Civic Center and the South of Market -- had turnout lower than the citywide average, which was just less than 30 percent. Supervisor Chris Daly said the key to win was turning out liberal voters -- not putting efforts into wooing conservatives. \"I truly believe I don't have to change people's minds,\" said Daly, who favors local control of the electrical system. \"I represent the majority opinion. But the majority doesn't necessarily come out to vote. That's what we have to work on.\"  PG&E CLEANING CONTAMINATED MARTINEZ SITE  - TWO FAMILIES LIVING ADJACENT TO THE SITE HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE UTILITY, BLAMING POLLUTION FOR ILLNESSES AND DEATHS MARTINEZ -- PG&E crews have begun cleaning up the site of a former substation in Martinez, which had high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil. Crews will begin cleaning up two adjacent properties after the Thanksgiving weekend. The adjacent property owners and their families blame the contaminants for the illnesses and deaths of family members and filed a claim against Pacific Gas & Electric in bankruptcy court. The substation cleanup should be completed by mid-December at a cost of $225,000, said PG&E spokesman Jason Alderman. Cleaning up Tom Billecci's and Vince Aiello's properties will cost about $64,000. Once the substation site is free of contaminants, the utility will sell the property to a developer, who plans to build apartments. The cost of the cleanup is significantly more than the utility will make selling the property, Alderman said. \"The reason it's expensive is that this is the gold standard of how an environmental cleanup should be done,\" he said. The utility operated a substation at the site from 1910 to 1990. The Billecci and Aiello families have been in discussions with PG&E about the cleanup for a year. They claim that the contaminants contributed to family illness including cancer, asthma and skin disorders. The utility will remove soil on both properties and test the ground to make sure it is free of high levels of lead and arsenic. Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Program will oversee the cleanup. PG&E will clean the area around a shed on Billecci's property, something it had not planned to do before. Billecci said he is pleased that PG&E agreed to increase the scope of the cleanup Reliant to slash rates 17 % when deregulation beginsResidential customers who stick with Reliant Energy when electricity deregulation begins in January could see a drop in power rates of about 17 percent. That's according to figures filed Friday by Reliant with the Texas Public Utility Commission. Under the new so-called price-to-beat rate - which still needs PUC approval - someone using an average of 1,200 kilowatt-hours a month could save $257 over the course of a year, while someone using an average of 2,000 kilowatt-hours a month could save $426 annually. The big drop is being propelled significantly by lower natural gas prices. Consumers saw two electricity increases in the latter half of 2000 and another this year because natural gas prices had climbed. This year's increase, though, was rescinded as gas prices came down. The rate Reliant offers residential consumers and certain small businesses come Jan. 1 - when Texas opens its electricity market to competition - is known as the \"price to beat.\" Larger consumers can negotiate contracts with providers. The price to beat will serve as a benchmark for other competitors, which in turn are expected to offer lower rates. Other incumbent electric companies, including Dallas-based TXU Energy, will charge their own price-to-beat rates in their service territories. The PUC wants the price to beat low enough so consumers benefit from deregulation, but high enough so competitors can offer lower rates but make enough profit to stay in the market. Consumer groups have said the PUC is paying too much attention to competitors' profits and not enough to ensuring consumers get the lowest prices. Under the deregulation law, consumers automatically get a 6 percent cut in the base portion starting Jan. 1, which, depending on usage, can make up 60 percent of a consumer's costs. The PUC and Reliant have been trying to agree on the so-called fuel-factor portion of the price to beat. The figure Reliant filed Friday was to agreed to by the PUC staff and the company. The three-member commission still must give its approval, which it could do Tuesday or at a Dec. 3 meeting. The current rate for a residential Reliant customer who uses 14,400 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a year - or an average of 1,200 a month - is 10.42 cents per kilowatt-hour. Under the numbers Reliant filed Friday, the cost would be 8.64 cents per kilowatt-hour. That's a drop of 17 percent. Those per kilowatt-hour figures are calculated to take into account that customers use more electricity in the summer when prices are higher. Reliant charges different rates for summer and non- summer months and will keep doing so after deregulation begins. The per kilowatt-hour comparisons compiled for the PUC are annualized, average rates. All providers will break their electricity offers into similar rates so consumers will have an apples-to-apples way to compare them. Reliant and other existing companies are prohibited from cutting the base-rate portion of the price to beat for three years or until they lose 40 percent of their customers. The price to beat can be adjusted twice a year for fuel costs. Earlier this week, consumer groups said they were worried that an option being considered by the PUC, if adopted, could artificially raise the price to beat and cause residential consumers to pick up costs that should be borne by larger customers. That option, which involves fuel costs that utilities are still owed, isn't included in Reliant's filing. A PUC spokesman said one commissioner simply wanted more information about the idea, and it's unknown whether the PUC will ever take an up-or-down vote. Competitors of Reliant and other existing companies are obviously interested in what the price to beat will be. In a filing Thursday with the PUC, the New Power Co., which is offering residential service in Houston and elsewhere, said the price to beat will ultimately determine if deregulation succeeds in Texas. Because there was a sufficient difference between current prices and rates offered by competitors during a pilot test of deregulation, a relatively high number of consumers signed up for new providers during the program, New Power said. \"New Power is optimistic that the Texas market will support vigorous competition, but, like everyone else, we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds,\" it said.", "Conflict": true, "Professional": true, "Tone": true, "Conflict Words %": 0.047701647875108416, "Friendly Words %": 0.07805724197745013, "Sentiment": 0.13728230970418476, "Subject Sentiment": 0.0, "Punctuation %": 0.02929399367755532}, {"Timestamp": "Tue, 13 Nov 2001 11:31:32 -0800 (PST)", "Sender": "darran.binns@enron.com\t/o=enron/ou=na/cn=recipients/cn=notesaddr/cn=f21d9b15-25189ad0-8625653f-482bf6@enron.com, ", "Recipient": "\tlynnette", "Subject": "California/National Power Issues", "Text": "Enron Direct and the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association (\"AUMA\") Seal a Natural Gas Supply DealYahooNovember 13, 2001  Dow  Jones InteractiveNovember 13, 2001  Media to get access to state power pactsR TumbleNovember 13, 2001   State energy spending plunges Water official trumpets decline as cost controlSF Gate NewsNovember 13, 2001     Enron Direct and the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association (\"AUMA\") Seal a Natural Gas Supply Deal AUMA regular and associate members have looked to Enron Direct's innovative and flexible energy solutions to answer AUMA's requirements of excellent customer service, competitive pricing and contract flexibility. \"Enron Direct is providing AUMA's regular and associate members with a natural gas supply and energy services plan to help them better manage their energy costs.

Enron is one of the world's leading energy, commodities and services companies. The company markets electricity and natural gas, delivers energy and other physical commodities, and provides financial and risk management services to customers around the world. Enron's Internet address is www.enron.com <http://www.enron.com/>. The stock is traded under the ticker symbol \"ENE.\" Visit Enron Direct's website at www.enrondirect.com <http://www.enrondirect.com>.   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- \"Noah's Ark\" should be the name of the company that emerges from the planned combination of Enron Corp. (ENE) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), according to energy markets lore these days. After all, the logic goes, there will be two of everyone. Enron traders aren't so sure of that, as energy firms can attest. \"In the past 60 days, the number of resumes from Enron personnel has increased substantially,\" said William Begley, head of the energy and utilities practice at Heidrick & Struggles (HSII), an executive recruiting firm in Houston. Resumes are coming from all units at Enron, but the number of those from traders has grown significantly during the period, he added. Other recruiting firms said that Enron traders have become more receptive to unsolicitied headhunting calls lately. No one knows for sure how jobs will shake out at Enron, as the company goes through hard times and faces a merger with Dynegy. Recruiters and Enron employees are mixed over how much actual fallout there will be. One thing they agree on, though, is that if Enron traders do leave, they aren't guaranteed to find new jobs quickly despite their credentials -- which are regarded as sterling in the energy industry. If energy markets contract as a result of Enron's troubles, the job market for traders could flood. Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap currently valued at $10.12 billion. The companies confirmed the deal late last week. Shares in both companies rose in heavy trading Monday as investors weighed the planned deal. Some uncertainty remains around the fate of the merger, partly because of the numerous regulatory hurdles it faces. Enron, still the largest energy trading company in the world, has suffered a massive setback in the past month. Four weeks ago, a $1.2 billion reduction of shareholder equity kicked off a slide in the company's share price, and prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Recruiters started seeing more resumes from Enron before the company's troubles came to a head. As early as this summer when former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling left the company, employees at the company's non-core units have been looking for jobs, recruiters said. Electricity and natural gas traders at Enron have long been considered some of the smartest participants in U.S. energy markets. The company is a market maker in both gas and electricity, meaning that its prices for both commodities are benchmarks for traders throughout the markets. Enron led the effort to deregulate U.S. power markets, and has been one of the most vocal lobbyists for deregulation at the state and federal levels over the years. \"Because Enron is such a large counterparty in the energy trading sector, all of its trading partners, everyone, is hoping the thing gets resolved,\" said Bruce Peterson, managing director at Korn/Ferry Intl (KFY) in Houston, an executive search company. \"The whole industry is definitely affected by what has happened at Enron. Until it's sorted out, you have a tremendous amount of uneasiness. It needs to get resolved.\" It will be essential for Dynegy to keep some of the core leadership from Enron, analysts say. By retaining the best, Dynegy should be able to secure other strong Enron employees. \"In our view, Enron's energy trading and marketing personnel are arguably the most talented and definitely the most profitable group in the industry,\" Prudential Securities analyst M. Carol Coale said in a research note Monday. \"We believe that Dynegy must focus on retaining these valuable traders and marketers if the new company is to realize its full potential in the wholesale segment.\" Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley, who will be at Dynegy after the merger as an executive vice president, said in a conference call on Monday that he believes the new company will retain its traders. \"Most traders want to be part of the winning team,\" he said. Some recruiters believe that although many Enron employees are floating resumes, there won't be much actual fallout. Enron's trading operation employs between 1,000 and 1,500 people in North America; Dynegy's operation is staffed by 300. \"But with a few trimmings here and there you won't see a lot of Enron traders on the street, unless they don't like what they hear from Dynegy,\" said Jack Carr managing director of Prime Energy Partnership, a search and recruiting company based in the UK, with an office in Greenwich, Connecticut. An experienced energy trader with four years of experience can earn $125,000-$150,000 plus a bonus, according to Carr. Right now, Enron traders are feeling disappointed and confused, according to one trader at another company who wouldn't allow his name to be used. \"I think they're very nervous,\" the trader said. \"The Enron people think they're better than the Dynegy people, and the Dynegy people think 'we're buying them, so we can just pick through their stuff.'\"  Media to get access to state power pactsA coalition of news organizations settled with the governor's office on the only remaining issue in a lawsuit seeking access to the state's contracts with power generators. The settlement will require the state to release short-term and spot-market energy contracts within 47 days of the end of each contract period. \"It's not as soon as we wanted, but it's not the lengthy delay the governor wanted. It's somewhere in between,\" said Alonzo Wickers, the attorney for the news organizations. Spot-market contracts are agreements for 90 days or less, and short-term contracts last 91 days to a year. The legal battle began in February, when a handful of news organizations, including The San Diego Union-Tribune, sued Gov. Gray Davis to get information about the contracts under the California Public Records Act. Davis' spokesman could not be reached for comment yesterday. In June, a Superior Court judge ordered the state to release its long-term contracts, which revealed that the contracts the governor negotiated had bound the state to huge electricity costs through the end of the decade. \"All the self-congratulatory proclamations from the governor's office about how beneficial these contracts were for the state of California didn't pan out,\" Wickers said. \"It certainly seems the public had a right to know.\" State energy spending plunges Water official trumpets decline as cost control Sacramento -- The state's spending on energy plummeted in October to its lowest level this year, according to figures released yesterday by the Department of Water Resources. California spent $415 million on power purchases in October, half of what it spent in August and $264 million less than in September. Since January, the state has been purchasing power for the three investor- owned utilities. At the market's peak, the cost of power was an average of $65 million a day. October's average was $13.4 million a day. \"These steep declines in our overall power expenses are an obvious signal that California has accomplished the task of controlling what were once runaway costs in the spot market,\" said Pete Garris, acting deputy director of the Department of Water Resources, which is in charge of buying the state's power. \"Each month since May, California has been able to slash hundreds of millions of dollars off its costs,\" Garris said. \"These overall costs are a good measure of how successful we've been in lowering the price of energy.\" However, the department said it did not have figures for how much power the state sold last month. Without those numbers, consumer advocates say, it is impossible to know how well the state is doing. \"We need to know the entire picture,\" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network. \"If we bought too much and are selling it at a loss, we need to know that.\" Hoge said this is especially important as the state begins to try to renegotiate long-term power contracts. Gov. Gray Davis and his administration began negotiating and signing long- term contracts during the height of the energy crisis. Davis and others say the contracts helped drive down the price of power, but critics say the state locked in too much power at too high a price. For the three months ending in June, the state sold about $25 million worth of power, at times even giving electricity away. \"We may need to take a broader look at the contracts,\" Hoge said. \"The downturn in natural gas prices has made a huge difference.\" That's because much of the electricity on the market is produced by plants that run on natural gas. Although the Davis administration has said it is open to renegotiating the contracts, it has made no progress thus far. A spokesman for the department said numbers detailing how much power the state has sold will be available later this month.

The dust has not yet settled on all of our ERCs for Roseville.  There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical. 2.    If we got this \"gift\", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state. Having said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.", "Conflict": false, "Professional": true, "Tone": true, "Conflict Words %": 0.09195402298850575, "Friendly Words %": 0.09195402298850575, "Sentiment": 0.24696317340067342, "Subject Sentiment": 0.0, "Punctuation %": 0.01956521739130435}], "thread300": [{"conflict": "yes", "professional": "yes", "tone": "stern"}, {"Timestamp": "Mon, 19 Nov 2001 09:11:28 -0800 (PST)", "Sender": "jbennett@gmssr.com", "Recipient": "jdasovic@enron", "Subject": "Implementation of the Suspension Direct Access -- UDCs' Plan", "Text": "On Friday, November 16th, the UDCs submitted their joint plan forimplementing the suspension of direct access.
