I think checks out of Bishops Corner, L.P. may be the easiest, or you can wire money to me and I can write the checks when needed.  Please let me know how you wish to handle this and I will proceed.Additionally, it is getting close to closing. I will need to get contracts signed at this point as soon as possible. We can handle this in two ways. I prefer that you elect me as a Vice - President of the General Partner and then I will sign all documents, or I can Federal Express contracts (this is more difficult).I have a funeral at 10:00 and I will be back about 1:00. I look forward to hearing from you.Greg  - Draw # 1 - 10.25.01.xls ",

Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.Happy New YearLouise",

I also don't think it makes sense to attack the large companies that have the DWR contracts. We generally end up working together on various issues and I do n't want to damage the relationships. I agree with many of the points John makes, but I don't want to be identified with the letter.Enron Wind also needs to see an Edison MOU bill passed so we can get paid our past due amounts and get our five year fixed energy price on our ISO4 contracts. I plan to be in Sacramento the next couple of days and will stop by Governmental Advocates.Regards,Hap",

Apparently, word is on the street that Peace intends to begin targeting Enron as an example of the \"misconduct\" that Peace alleges has occured in California's markets.  Smutney thinks Peace may be keying off the comments of the \"unnamed\" trader in the Dow article claiming that Enron's been buying power and holding on to it.  the design of this market are now colluding to profit unfairly from it.\"  No idea of when and how Peace might launch any attacks.  Two immediate thoughts:Apart from the bad reporting in the Dow article, that article shows that Enron got beat by, among others, two federal (Canada and the US), one state (SRP) and one municipal (LADWP) government.David Freeman, who now heads up LADWP, was appointed \"Czar\" by the State of California and charged with the task of implementing Steve Peace's brain child (AB 1890).  Freeman set up the ISO and PX market structures.  He also set up the Governing Boards.",

They made the following points:The Governor is personally spending a great deal of time on electricity=20issues (and is forcing them to spend their time on it as well).The Governor recognizes that part of the problem is a supply shortage, but==20they put special emphasis on the view that in addition to supply shortfalls=,=20a big part of the problem is a \"dysfunctional market\" -- a thinly veiled=20reference to price manipulation by people sitting in the room.The Governor's view is that all participants (regulators, utilities,=20customers and generators) must \"behave responsibly\".Everyone must \"share the pain\".The legislative battles are likely to start as soon as the legislature=20returns next week, and the Governor will be putting forth several legislati=ve=20proposals in the next couple of weeks.While staff went out of its way to say that the list of proposals (in the==20attached e-mail) were unofficial and for discussion purposes only, it was==20fairly clear that they defined much of what the governor plans to propose.The meeting was not very encouraging nor did it provide much in the way of==20new information.  The IEP group was on message, making the usual arguments==20about the need for forward contracting, expedited generation and transmissi=on=20siting, a real retail market to promote demand side responses, etc.  The=20staff is clearly focussed on forward contracting as part of the solution bu=t=20remains committed to the idea that generators have to cough up some money a=nd=20remain subject to rate caps, possible restrictions on sales outside the sta=te=20(at least at peak times), etc.  One approach they appear to be toying with =is=20a \"share the pain\" proposal which would have utilities absorbing some of th=e=20deferred costs and consumers absorbing some of the deferred costs in the fo=rm=20of higher rates.  That leaves generators ... who they might want to either==20agree to some refunds or provide power at lower going-forward prices.The staff says that they remain open to proposed solutions, but the Davis==20administration appears unwilling to spend any political capital to fix the==20problem. =20I think we are in for a lengthy legislative and PUC fight.  We should, as==20always, provide consistent and reasonable solutions.  I think we should=20prepare a document for distribution to staff, legislators (and anyone else)==20that takes the factual background and proposed solutions we have put forwar=d=20(eg in Belden's presentation and the Seabron Adamson whitepaper) and wraps==20them in a more political context.  In other words, we have already=20articulated the right answers; we now need to put a political rationale=20around our proposals -- a set of arguments which responds directly to the==20political opposition those answers are likely to encounter.

We do not have Growney and Brady's picks at this point- BUT thatdoes not mean that they do not have valid picks in.  However, we do not copyanyone on the picks if we have not received theirs for some reason.Please note that the names are in descending alphabetical order so that atleast one week out of the season, WAM has his name at the top (just kidding,Andre).
