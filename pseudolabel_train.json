        "Text": "Kern Gets Speedy OK; Breathitt Questions Action FERC moved with record speed to issue a certificate last week to Kern River Gas Transmission for its 135 MMcf/d, mostly compression, expansion to the natural gas-starved California market, but not all of the commissioners were happy with the expedited manner in which the project was approved. \"The speed with which the Commission has acted in this proceeding is something which will no doubt be touted as a great effort,\" but the \"precedent we have created could be a double-edged sword,\" warned Commissioner Linda Breathitt in a partial dissent of the decision. Although she voted in favor of the certificate in the end, she questioned whether FERC \"should...be willing to sacrifice careful review for speedy action.\" Breathitt further said she seriously doubted the so-called California Action expansion of the 900-mile,Wyoming-to-California Kern River system merited the \"extraordinary regulatory treatment\" that the Commission gave it. Critics claim that the $81 million project will not flow any more gas to the Wheeler Ridge Interconnection in California than is currently available there, she noted, adding that it would simply displace existing gas. \"...[I]t will not necessarily result in any net increase of natural gas in the California marketplace. This makes it difficult to understand just how our approval of Kern River's proposal is going to assist in increasing electric generation in California this summer,\" Breathitt said. If anything, she noted the project could make the congestion problem at Wheeler Ridge even worse than it is. There should have been a \"fuller airing of this issue\" at FERC before the project was certificated, she noted. \"It would be counterproductive for this Commission to act precipitously on projects related to California without ensuring that they will, in reality, benefit specific markets --- and more importantly, that they will cause no further harm.\" The Commission majority, however, readily dismissed protests of Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), Southern California Gas and other California customers, that claim the Kern River expansion would degrade service to existing customers. They requested that existing customers be given priority over expansion shippers. \"We conclude that the California Action Project will not have undue negative impacts on existing shippers or competing pripelines,\" the order said [CP01-106. For starters, \"the record does not show that pro-rata allocations of primary firm capacity have been a problem at Wheeler Ridge.\" Kern River reports that the aggregate primary firm delivery rights of its shippers at Wheeler Ridge will increase to about 527 MMcf/d from 450 MMcf/d as a result of this project. At the same time, the design delivery capacity at the Wheeler Ridge Meter Station will be increased to about 800 MMcf/d from 598 MMcf/d to accommodate existing shippers, new expansion shippers and Mojave Pipeline shippers, it noted. \"Therefore, the expanded delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge will be greater than the sum of the combined Kern River and Mojave contract volumes. The Commission recognizes that this does not factor in the volumes attributable to both PG&E and local production that are also delivered to Wheeler Ridge. However, our emphasis is on Kern River being able to provide sufficient delivery point capacity for its customers,\" the order said. \"The solution to the problem of pro-rata allocations of any services at Wheeler Ridge lies not with the interstate pipelines, but rather in fixing the problem with the take-away capacity and the lack of firm transportation path rights on SoCalGas, a matter which is beyond our jurisdiction.\" The project would increase the \"limited-term, incremental transportation capacity\" of Kern River by 135 MMcf/d from Wyoming to California to help address the urgent need for additional gas in the West. An estimated 53,900 horsepower would be added to the pipeline, including three new compressor stations, and upgraded facilities at three existing compressor stations and an existing meter station. The project, which has been fully subscribed, has a targeted in-service date of July 1 of this year. Kern River plans to use a mix of permanent and temporary facilities on the project, with the temporary facilities intended to be subsequently replaced by permanent 2002 California Expansion Project facilities (which is pending at FERC), and the permanent facilities to be incorporated into the design of the pipeline's 2002 and 2003 California Expansion Projects.

The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.Thanks,Jeff",

Thanks.Best,Jeff----- Forwarded by Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron on 06/20/2001 05:23 PM -----\tJeff Dasovich\t06/19/2001 07:11 PM\t\t James D Steffes/NA/Enron@Enron, Richard Shapiro/NA/Enron@Enron, skean@enron.com, Paul Kaufman/Enron@EnronXGate, Susan J Mara/NA/Enron@ENRON, Phillip K Allen/Enron@EnronXGate, Christian Yoder/Enron@EnronXGate, Steve C Hall/ENRON@enronXgateContracts--Privileged and Confidential\tPLEASE KEEP THIS NOTE, AND THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE NOTE CONFIDENTIAL.As folks are aware, we have been engaged in closed-door negotiations for the past two weeks regarding a possible market-based solution to California's electricity crisis.In the room are the major large customer groups, environmentalists, small customers (TURN), Independent Energy Producers, labor, the Western States Petroleum Association, and Enron.The negotiations were convened by the Speaker of the Assembly (Bob Hertzberg).When Hertzberg convened the meeting, he told the parties that he wanted to achieve a core/noncore structure, similar to the structure in place in California's gas market (i.e., large customers are required to buy gas from the market, with Direct Access available to all other customers).In effect, \"core\" customers (rez and small business) would be served by the utilities' retained generating assets and QF contracts; and large customers would go to market.  The core/noncore structure would begin 1.1.03.The negotiating group has struggled over the past two weeks, but is close devising a framework for core/noncore in Californis (but who pays for the utilities' past debts and the costs of DWR power purchased between January and today remain very contentious).Unfortunately, with the release of the information regarding the DWR contracts last Friday, it is now clear that achieving a core/noncore structure will be very difficult unless something is done to mitigate the contracts.The problem is that, if core is served by utility gen and QFs, and large customers are in the market, there is no (or very little) need for the DWR contracts.  Instead, they look like a signficant stranded cost.Hertzberg and the negotiating group are looking to Enron for creative ways to address \"the DWR contract problem\" in order to prevent the contracts from 1) killing the core/noncore deal and 2) forcing California to accept a structure focused on a state power authority headed-up by David Freeman that does not include Direct Access.Christian Yoder and Steve Hall are reviewing the contracts to analyze any \"out clauses\" that the buyer and/or the seller might have under the contract provisions.  (My cursory review of the contracts suggests that \"outs\" for the state are minimal or nonexistent.)In addition, we've started batting around ideas about how the State might reform the contracts.All this said, want to let everyone know that we have made it extremely clear that Enron fundamentally opposes any and all attempts to unilaterally abrogate anyone's contract rights.We'd like to have a quick call tomorrow (30-60 minutes) to brainstorm some options that we can offer Hertzberg to handle the contracts and keep the core/noncore solution alive.  We'd like to try to have the the call at 1 PM PDT.  Please let me know if this works for you, and if it doesn't, please let me know if there's a time after 1 PM PDT that works for you.Thanks,Jeff",

RABIN; DARYL KELLEY; RICH CONNELLTIMES STAFF WRITERS07/28/2001Los Angeles TimesHome EditionA-1Copyright 2001 / The Times Mirror CompanyThe Davis administration, stung by charges of excessive secrecy, disclosed late Friday that it has fired five energy consultants because of conflicts of interest involving their official duties and personal finances. A sixth consultant hired to help California purchase electricity has quit, according to state records.All were involved in purchasing electricity for the state from a generator whose stock they owned. In addition, the top lawyer for the agency buying the power was removed from her position because of concern about the way the issue of potential conflicts was handled. Top advisors to Gov. Gray Davis told The Times that they learned of the conflicts in the last week, after belatedly asking the consultants to file required economic disclosure statements. A review of those documents, which included stock holdings, showed that some of the consultants \"may have crossed the line,\" said the governor's senior advisor, Nancy McFadden. State law prohibits officials from participating in decisions involving their personal financial interests. Although portraying himself as seriously concerned that such conflicts could undermine public confidence, the governor has not required some of his most influential private-sector advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to the firings. Among them are two Wall Street veterans who have been most influential in promoting the governor's energy rescue plan, which includes the largest state bond sale in U.S. history. The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. \"The governor's approach may be convenient for him,\" said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, \"but it ignores the law.\" Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that \"decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,\" Knox said. \"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing.\" The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of \"a conscious policy of secrecy\" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. \"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks,\" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. \"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer,\" Mead said. \"[He] just said your services are terminated. \"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns.\" Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended \"I don't see a conflict,\" he said. \"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron.\" Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. \"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he wrote. \"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters.\" \"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person.\" However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

The New York firms that employ executives Joseph Fichera and Michael Hoffman have been paid $275,000 a month to, among other things, help pitch the $12.5-billion bond issue to Wall Street analysts and state lawmakers. The companies stand to make an additional $14 million if the state goes through with the purchase of utility transmission lines. Davis contends that Fichera, Hoffman and their associates fall into a separate category of advisor, beyond the reach of the state's political reform laws. Critics question the distinction. \"The governor's approach may be convenient for him,\" said Jim Knox, executive director of the watchdog group California Common Cause, \"but it ignores the law.\" Disclosure is crucial because the public needs to know that \"decisions are not being made by people who have a conflict of interest,\" Knox said. \"Trying to evade the law with a creative use of semantics is not what they ought to be doing.\" The firings disclosed Friday are unlikely to diminish criticism surrounding the more than 50 consultants and advisors hastily hired by the administration as it rushed into the power trading business this year. More than $25 million is being spent by the state on consultants, according to state records. In the process, seemingly little attention was paid to routine government ethics laws. It took six months for state officials to direct the consultants to file even basic disclosures of their personal finances, including investments. The state Political Reform Act normally requires such forms to be filed publicly within 30 days of starting work for state agencies. Even with the hastily ordered disclosures made public thus far, the circumstances of most of the stock transactions remain a mystery because key information was omitted. Most of the consultants, for example, failed to state when they bought the energy stocks. One of those pressing hardest for an investigation of possible conflict of interest violations and insider trading is Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who hopes to challenge Davis next year. Jones has accused the governor of \"a conscious policy of secrecy\" in enforcing compliance with public disclosure laws. This week Jones called for a federal Securities and Exchange Commission probe of stock purchases by state energy consultants. 4 Traders Owned Shares of Calpine The four traders removed this week all owned shares of Calpine Corp., a San Jose-based power generator that has landed the largest share of the $43 billion in long-term state power contracts. Their investments ranged from several thousand dollars to more than $100,000, records show. While working for the state Department of Water Resources, officials said they bought undetermined amounts of Calpine power on the state's behalf. More than $14 million worth of electricity was purchased from the state by Calpine in the first quarter of this year, according to the most recent records available. \"We did not want them making governmental decisions and holding these stocks,\" the governor's legal affairs secretary, Barry Goode, said in an interview. The highest-ranking consultant removed, Richard Ferreira, was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to assist in obtaining bids for long-term power and negotiating contracts, records show. A former assistant general manager with the Sacramento Municipal Utility District, Ferreira was paid $200 an hour by the state. After he disclosed owning as much as $10,000 in Calpine stock, officials discovered he had participated in a review of one of the company's contracts. Ferreira could not be reached for comment. The governor's office identified the other four as traders William F. Mead, Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng, most of whom could not be reached Friday by The Times. All of them formerly worked as energy schedulers at the Power Exchange, a now-defunct energy market similar to a stock exchange created in the early days of California's electricity deregulation. Hired by the state in February and March, the four signed temporary contracts calling for maximum payments of between $15,000 and $21,000 a month, including living expenses in Sacramento and flights home to Southern California. Mead, 55, a former Edison engineer, said state officials never warned him that owning energy stock was a problem until they demanded that he sell the stock a week ago. He said he bought nearly all of his shares 2 1/2 years ago for $12,000 and saw its value skyrocket as the stock split three times, doubling in value each time. Mead said he was called by the head of the state's energy buying team Thursday and fired. \"I asked very directly, 'Is this because of the stock?' and they wouldn't give me an answer,\" Mead said. \"[He] just said your services are terminated. \"I came up here, away from home, living in a hotel room, trying to keep the lights on, trying to get the state through a crisis and now I get a finger pointed at me as if I'm some sort of criminal. I guess it's just politics and we're the pawns.\" Administration officials said they also are examining the actions of other traders, including one who bought Calpine stock just before beginning work for the state. That trader, Elaine Griffin, who also came from the Power Exchange, left the state power buying operation July 14, three days after disclosing her energy industry investment. Griffin, who the governor's office said had obtained another job, could not be reached for comment. Griffin reported purchasing $10,000 to $100,000 of Calpine stock on Feb. 1, in her final days working at the electricity exchange. A few days later, Calpine signed and announced a $4.6-billion, 10-year deal to sell power to the Department of Water Resources. On Feb. 20, Griffin joined the state power buying agency, just as the state and Calpine were finalizing an additional $8.3 billion in power contracts. One of those, a 20-year deal signed Feb. 27, was the longest. The state has awarded Calpine about $13 billion in contracts to supply power for up to 20 years. In addition to the state consultants who bought Calpine stock, two others reported owning stock in Texas-based power marketing giant Enron Corp. And two more bought stock in Southern California Edison, the faltering utility that Davis has committed himself to saving from bankruptcy. Another consultant bought stock in Reliant Energy of Houston, a large power plant operator that bought several California plants from utilities after deregulation. Bernard Barretto, an energy trader, who buys energy on the daily spot market, said in an interview that he bought about $2,000 in Enron stock shortly before he began work for the state Feb. 28. Purchase of Enron Stock Defended \"I don't see a conflict,\" he said. \"At the time, we weren't really dealing with Enron. I [still] haven't bought from Enron.\" Barretto said he never considered his Enron ownership a possible conflict until he received notice July 18 that he had to sell the stocks by noon or lose his job. That notice came from Goode, the governor's lawyer. \"We expect and have always expected the state's consultants to uphold the highest ethical standards,\" he wrote. \"That standard is not met by those who hold a financial interest in one or more energy companies while trading on behalf of the state on energy related matters.\" \"Therefore each consultant who holds an interest in an energy company must divest himself or herself of that interest by noon today. If he or she refuses, the state will sever its contract with that person.\" However, the governor's office has taken a distinctly different stance with his closest financial advisors, Fichera and Hoffman. Davis aides cite an opinion sought last week from attorney Raquelle de la Rocha, a former member of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission and the state Fair Political Practices Commission. She concluded that the advisors do not have to file disclosure statements because they are contractors, not consultants, and will be working for less than a year on a limited range of projects. Fichera is Davis' point man on the governor's energy rescue plan--including the unprecedented bond sale. He has pitched the plan to lawmakers, reporters and the Wall Street financial community. Fichera refused to comment on the record. Fichera and Hoffman's companies, Saber Partners and Blackstone Group, prepared a controversial analysis that helped underpin legislative approval of the bond measure, intended to pay for past and future power buying. Pact Specifies Financial Advice The state's contract with the Fichera and Hoffman firms calls for them to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. The decision not to require public disclosure of their financial holdings stands in sharp contrast to the approach taken with Montague DeRose and Associates. That consulting firm was hired on a $1.8-million contract. Like the other two firms, it too was hired to provide \"financial advisory services\" to the state. That firm's top advisor, Douglas S. Montague, was required by the administration to fill out a disclosure statement. He reported no power company interests. The governor's legal advisors said the difference is that Montague is on a longer contract.Copyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc. All Rights Reserved. ",

To stimulate discussion we proposed that the utility fill 5% of its net short position with 5-year, fixed-price contracts and 5% from 10-year, fixed-price contracts.Everyone on the call liked the proposal.  After some discussion about whether 5%-5% was the right one, Edison agreed to come to Friday's meeting with its proposal for price/term/quantity that it ought to contract for immediately.  (Edison may want the number to be higher, and the baskets to be different.)Anything can happen between now and Friday, but thus far looks positive.  Thanks to everyone for the help in getting the proposal together, Steve Swain portfolios for the group.)  I'll report back on what happens at the meeting on Friday.

They intend to submit it with their testimony in the FERC case.Best,Jeff\tJames D Steffes\t05/02/2001 11:15 AM\t\t Alvarez/NA/Enron@ENRON, Alan Comnes/PDX/ECT@ECT, Leslie Lawner/NA/Enron@Enron, Rebecca W Cantrell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Robert Neustaedter/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Christi L Nicolay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeff Dasovich/NA/Enron@Enron\tJoe Hartsoe received a call from Commission staff at FERC to try and understand why basis differentials into California were so big and why the large basis continues.  Clearly with the new Electricity Order, natural gas is one of the primary factors on electricity prices in California.Our key fear, however small, is that FERC (or someone else) recognizes the huge implication of natural gas prices and seeks to cap natural gas sales for resale of P/L affiliates (such as ENA).  There is some fear that the real monopoly is the holder of LT firm capacity, not the gas production firms.We need to develop a good story as to why the basis gas continues and messaging it quietly into the right FERC staff to keep the pressure of additional Investigations from happening.  Joe is trying to get his hands on the Lukens study presented to the California study Committee on natural gas abuse to help guide our analysis.  Jim",

Thanks so much for arranging it. We'll have a great time--and Cameron and I have already ironed out a nice deal concerning eyeing the Playmates. (I suggest you do the same, Jeff, or are you above gawking at plastic tits?) Jeff and I have our fig leaves all picked out...As far as fetching you at LAX... Because Cameron and I (and PP and Jeff?) are going down on the 30th, we should rent a car then. When Eldon and Nancy come in, we'll already have a car, and so we can just collect you and go right to the hotel. Does that sound okay? That way, you guys won't have to rent a car when you get in. (I'll put Eldon on as a driver so that he can take over behind the wheel, if he wants to do that.) What kind of car should I get? Do we drive to the mansion? Now that I think about it, that would mean we need to squeeze 6 in one car. Anyway, let me know what your thought are on this.Have a great time with the Hopkins. Merry Christmas to PP and Jeff.

They did not vote out an order today, but expect to take up this issue again next meeting.  The staff memo recommended the following:For an interim period, FERC will deal with pending requests for market based rates and with triennial reviews of those rate authorizations, using a new test called the \"Supply Margin Assessment\" (also called a jazzed up version of the hub and spoke test) where a seller's capacity will be reviewed against the generation reserve margin in a market.  The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  Since the interim measure is only a \"snapshot\" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.  Commissioner Breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement, stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the Commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability.",

The test takes into account constraints based on TTC.  If the capacity of a seller is not necessary to meet peak demand,the seller does not have market power.  This test is applicable to all markets that are not part of an existing RTO or ISO.  For those selling into an RTO/ISO, the FERC will continue to allow market based rates subject to the market monitor and mitigation.  Staff also recommends that FERC initiate a Section 206 investigation to require each seller with market based rate authority to change its tariff by adding a provision stating that if the seller acts in an anticompetitive manner, the FERC can require refunds.  Through questioning by Commissioner Massey, it was revealed that, even if a seller did not engage in bad behavior, but sold into a disfunctional market, refunds could be required.  In the staff memo, apparently staff had left vague the definition of anticompetitive behavior in order to be able to interpret it most broadly.  However, Commissioners asked staff to better define the anticompetitive actions that could trigger refunds.  This policy will be brought up again at the next Commission meeting on October 11.  It will be issued as a proposed action, giving parties an opportunity to comment within 15 days and then also file reply comments,  Final action is expected within 60-90 days.Last, for the long-term, FERC will hold outreach meetings looking for answers as to how to detect market power and what to do when it is detected.  Since the interim measure is only a \"snapshot\" approach according to Commissioner Massey, he is willing to support it only along with the above described tariff provision.  Commissioner Breathitt is very uncomfortable with an open refund requirement, stating that it adds to regulatory uncertainty at a time when the Commission is most interested in giving certainty to the industry in order to assure reliability.",

Can we recover any additional costs, such as the cost of preparing/filing docs on their behalf (2.2) and collection (3.1)?

Springer\" <Boyd_J._Springer@jonesday.com> on 06/12/2000 07:23:44 PM_______________________________________________________________This message and any attachments are intended for the individual or entitynamed above.  If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read,copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify thesender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system.Thank you._______________________________________________________________Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections isto significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event thatgovernmental action related to the agreement is modified in a mannerunacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can comeat any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involveapproval  \"required\" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did notpropose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement whichrefers to adverse \"rate approval\". However, Peoples' intent may be toobtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decisionre the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of atermination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarilyrequired for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified \"in any mannerwhich is unacceptable\" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with theoriginal language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right tocircumstances when a \"required\" approval is revoked.) While the broadenedtermination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, Iwouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of amodified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agencyarrangement.2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenuedefinition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market HubSerivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, theproposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the termof the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to marketextended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination ofthe Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the lastsentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative netrevenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH'sperspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actuallyrefunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not requirea retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreementterminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would beneeded.3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it makenominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt ordelivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at asecondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. didagree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not knowthe value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC bedefined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC mayelect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peopleseffective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may bemodified from time to time.\" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to proposechanges to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate thatParking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review thisfurther.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified thelanguage giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC toassign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply withrequirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not becertificated as a \"natural gas company\", if there is another entity withclear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act andFERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicatingthat Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensurecompliance with regulatory requirements.          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of thesending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change ininformation re firm capacity. Perhaps \"in its sole discretion\" can bedelted and the last word of the third sentence changed to \"appropriate\".                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list ofgrounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies thegrounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should notadd to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce providedunder the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illinioistariffs have equal scheduling priority.                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places therisk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. Thisis how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. Withthe changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment riskalso may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should followresponsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-paymentrisk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based ona credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to theadministrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refundsfor ten business days. Should there be an interest component?                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. ThisSection suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'mdon't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimizeimbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 areexpected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoplesshould attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them onWed.                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties toindicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with \"material\" contractcs andJudgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is itsuffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with someLaws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did nothave a flat fee component.15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable toboth Peoples and MEH, People should not have \"sole\" authority to prepareand file all applications.                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments abovere Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word\"expressly\" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1. Should theSection require consent for transfer by operation of law if we wish to havethis requirement in the event that the Hub facilities are sold?          18. Sect. 15.1 (a). If this type of provision is going to beincluded, should there at least be an initial period (say a year) to getstarted which doesn't trigger a termination right? The NIGAS Agreement hada section along these lines.          19. Sect. 15.1 (f). See comments above re Governmental Approval.                                                   20.

It seems reasonably to allow MEH toterminate if it believes that HUB marketability is impaired, without a needto demonstrate reasonableness.                                         22. Sect. 17.1 I don't understandwhy Peoples wishes to require confidentiality for the compensationsections.

Springer\" <Boyd_J._Springer@jonesday.com> on 06/12/2000 07:23:44 PM_______________________________________________________________This message and any attachments are intended for the individual or entitynamed above.  If you are not the intended recipient, please do not read,copy, use or disclose this communication to others; also please notify thesender by replying to this message, and then delete it from your system.Thank you._______________________________________________________________Here are my comments re Peoples' mark-up:                                         1. Sects. 1.1, 1.11, 10.2, and15.1(f). The combined effect of the proposed changes to these sections isto significantly broaden the terminantion right in the event thatgovernmental action related to the agreement is modified in a mannerunacceptable to either party. As changed the unacceptable approval can comeat any time during the term of the agreement, and need not  involveapproval  \"required\" for the agreement to remain effective. Peoples did notpropose to include language from the comparable NIGAS Hub Agreement whichrefers to adverse \"rate approval\". However, Peoples' intent may be toobtain a termination remedy in the event of an adverse rate-making decisionre the treatment of Hub revenues. In any event, the meaning of atermination right triggered if a government approval (not necessarilyrequired for the agreement to remain in effect) is modified \"in any mannerwhich is unacceptable\" is, at best, unclear. We should try to stay with theoriginal language (or, perhaps, limit expansion of the termination right tocircumstances when a \"required\" approval is revoked.) While the broadenedtermination right proposed by Peoples is available to either party, Iwouldn't think it likely that MEH would wish to terminate as a result of amodified regualtory decision not required for continuation of the agencyarrangement.2. Sects. 1.6, 7.1. 2.2, 2.10 (comments re cumulative net revenuedefinition) As modified, MEH is charged with the duty to market HubSerivces, which includes Extended Hub Serivces (Def'n. 1.17). However, theproposed Adminisatrative Service Fee (7.1) is only payable during the termof the Agreement. MEH, therefore, is required by the Agreement to marketextended Hub Services, but receives no compensation (after termination ofthe Agreement) for doing so. Also, Peoples proposes to add provision (C)eliminating refund amounts from the definition of Cumulative Net Revenue.Apparently in conjuction with this, Peoples proposes to delete the lastsentence of 1.6 which requires a retroactive adjustment of cumulative netrevenue in the event of a refund. Peoples also has bracketed 7.3,apparently intending to exclude it. I suppose this is fine from MEH'sperspective. The effect of these changes is to deduct only amounts actuallyrefunded from the revenue base for the administrative fee, and not requirea retroactive adjustment. This could benefit MEH if the agreementterminates before a refund is required. No retroactive adjustment would beneeded.3. Sect. 1.9, 2.5. Peoples proposes to delete the requirement that it makenominating or scheduling changes on interstate pipelines for receipt ordelivery of gas needed for hub transactions or delivery of gas at asecondary point for displacement delivery. Northern Illinois Gas Co. didagree to these provision in the contract with its Hub Agent. I do not knowthe value of these commitments to MEH from a business standpoint.                         4. Sect. 1.13. Peoples proposes that the GTC bedefined to included changes made by Peoples in its sole discretion.Peoples, however, is not free to change the GTC as it sees fit. FERC mayelect to allow changes proposed by Peoples to become effective, but Peopleseffective general Terms and Conditions of the Operating Statament as may bemodified from time to time.\" Sect. 6.1 gives Peoples a right to proposechanges to the GTC, so there is no need to cover that here.                              5. Sect. 1.17. The GTC does not indicate thatParking and Loaning Service must be interruptible. I will review thisfurther.                      6. Sect. 2.2. Peoples has modified thelanguage giving it responsibility to ensure compliance with the GTC toassign this obligation to both parties. The intent was to comply withrequirements of FERC orders indicating that an agent need not becertificated as a \"natural gas company\", if there is another entity withclear responponsibilty to ensure compliance with the Natural Gas Act andFERC regulations. I suggest we stay with the origianl language indicatingthat Peoples, the certificate holder, has the responsibility to ensurecompliance with regulatory requirements.          7. Sect. 2.4b The thrid sentence is confusing in light of thesending sentence indicating that MEH must consent to a change ininformation re firm capacity. Perhaps \"in its sole discretion\" can bedelted and the last word of the third sentence changed to \"appropriate\".                              8. Sect. 2.5. New Item 3 of the list ofgrounds for refusal should be deleted. The GTC (Sect. 8.2) specifies thegrounds on which Hub Serivce can be denied. The Agency Agreement should notadd to this. Also, the GTC expressly requires that firm serivce providedunder the Operating Statement and firm serivce under peoples' Illinioistariffs have equal scheduling priority.                                   9. Sect. 2.10. This Section places therisk of non-payment on MEH, unless Peoples conducts the credit check. Thisis how risk was allocated in the NIGAS Hub Agreement. That agreement,however, provided for a 50/50 split of Hub revenue. As proposed by Peoples,MEH would receive only an agency fee and lesser percentage of revenue. Withthe changed allocation of revenue, a changed allocation of non-payment riskalso may be appropriate. Normally, the this risk should followresponsibility for accepting the transaction. At a minimum, non-paymentrisk should be assigned to Peoples if (i) it performs the credit check; or(ii) requires MEH to accept a Hub customer which MEH has rejected based ona credit analysis conducted under the GTC (Sect. 8.2).     10. Sect. 3.3. The required refunds could be large relative to theadministrative fee. The revised language requires MEH to finance refundsfor ten business days. Should there be an interest component?                                                        11. Sect. 3.4. ThisSection suggests that MEH will receive a fee for Extended Hub Services. I'mdon't see how this occurs under the revised language.   12. Sect. 3.5.Peoples proposes to delete the language requiring best efforts to minimizeimbalances. Compliance filings due this summer under FERC Order 637 areexpected to offer incentives related to avoidance of imbalances and Peoplesshould attempt to use these procedures. We should discuss this with them onWed.                    13. Sect. 5.1. Peoples has modified the warranties toindicate consistency of the Agency Agreement with \"material\" contractcs andJudgments or Laws not expected to have a material adverse effect. Is itsuffucuent to have minor contract violations and inconsistency with someLaws/Judgments?               14. Sect. 7.1 The NIGAS Hub Agreement did nothave a flat fee component.15. Sect. 10.1. Because the Governmental Approval must be acceptable toboth Peoples and MEH, People should not have \"sole\" authority to prepareand file all applications.                                         16. Sect. 10.2. See comments abovere Governmental Approval. Also, I don't think there is a need for the word\"expressly\" in the first sentence.            17. Sect. 11.1.

All dogs go through adjustments.  She may be trying to find out who is the boss.  There are lots of little tricks I can tell you about to show her you are the boss.  I'll try to make you a list while you are gone.  CRATE TRAIN HER!!  It is one of the best things you will ever do for yourself.  She may fuss at first, but she will love it. Crating her will calm her down. I believe the Pointer Rescue people agree.  ckmI think I'll try the treat approach and see if that helps.  I scold her and then tell her I love her and pet and kiss her and she pops right back.  She's not a dumb dog, just a stubborn dog!I'm not feeling very good again today, probably lack of sleep!  She was looking pretty drowsy herself this morning too, she didn't get her 10 hours of sleep.  I bet the neighbors are just loving us.  Oh well!I'll print this out now.

        "Text": "As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.Thank you.",

        "Subject": "Overview of Investor Conference Call",
        "Text": "Today, Enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview =of the company. Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter=ests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit qualit=y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe=ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses.It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot =of significant events that led to our current situation:-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co=re businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azu=rix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have eve=r imagined when we made these investments;-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa=ny. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex=tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in=vestor confidence, which has been very damaging;-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under=stand financial and operating disclosures; and-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as d=iscussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previo=usly reported earnings.We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three=Core BusinessesOur core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant ear=nings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. Th=ese include:-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on ou=r projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this ti=me what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering= these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002=.I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple =of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity =concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen i=mprovement in our counterparty relationships.Non-Core BusinessesOur non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband d=ivision. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the= return from them has been dismal.We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect =that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash= that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We alre=ady have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. Th=ey include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LN=G receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and ga=s properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale= is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.Businesses Under ReviewThese businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and ga=s wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While sev=eral of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to dete=rmine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are suff=icient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make= reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it b=ecomes available.Credit Rating/10-Q FilingWe continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that =our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our ba=lance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current cr=edit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:-- Moody's at Baa3       \"Under Review for Further Downgrade\"-- Fitch at BBB-             \"Evolving Status\"-- S&P at BBB-              \"CreditWatch Negative\"We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin= and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 1=0-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. =19.We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as we=ll as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference =call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next =few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/inve=stors under \"SEC Filings.\"=20=20In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a =joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commissio=n.

Jim and Betty Boyd sat behind us at the wedding. Mauricio and his wife were there, and showed no signs of leaving.  When Neil and I left at 130 (Michael was with grandparents)  the band was still playing, and the bride and groom were still there.  Unbelievable.

Can you believe we never broke a window?  We have a detached garage, but the door is metal.  I can't imagine how loud that would be!I remember trying to encourage Paige to swim, bike, whatever.

I think that's whatshe wants to tell you.Well, Annie is outside pounding the tennis ball against the wall. I guess Ishould go and give her a glove to pitch to. Oh, by the way. When she wasMichael's age we signed her up for t-ball. She spent the first practice intears. So, we pulled her off and waited before we started her.

I don't know what it is about us, but we alwaysseem to end up in Theme Parks when the temperature is over 103. We call thatCrowd Bustin' Temps! We had a great time and we are completely exhausted.The girls are getting ready for bed without even complaining. It was fun togo, but if I were you I would hire Paige to take Michael there! It haschanged since we were kids, but it is really a teenage heaven -- I thinkthere are like 8 HUGE roller coasters. Did you know that it isn't fungetting nauseated anymore?? Pink Things still taste great and the GunslingerShow is still funny!We didn't really see much of mom and dad until today. It was nice chattingwith them. I can tell that Mama is getting a little bit of cabin fever.Tomorrow she starts her exercise class and she's going out for lunch. When Icalled her when we got home she said that Daddy's leg was feeling muchbetter. I could tell that the knee incident on Friday really upset themboth. I think they were afraid that it wouldn't get better. But, it seemslike it is better now. I'm keeping my fingers crossed.Mother is really looking forward to the surprise birthday. We gave dad acopy of the movie My Dog Skip for his present while we were there, completewith his birthday card. (Just to muddy the water a bit!)Now, let me see if I can remember the things Mama wanted me to tell you. Iknow that she wanted me to tell you that she won't be able to stock up onsoft drinks, juice or other things like that since it would make Daddysuspicious. I'll probably bring Pop Tarts for the kids breakfast on Sunday.Plus drinks and juice.  Also, do you know if we will be having birthday cakefor desert? If not, let me know and I can always bring one. I'll bring Budand wine and kid drinks. Anything else?I can't believe we were able to go and visit and not spill the beans. That'spretty good for us!I wish we were still on \"vacation\", but I guess you have to come back to thereal world sometime. When we got home we had phone messages from Bobby'ssister and aunt and a note from his dad. I think I'll wait and talk to themtomorrow. They take a lot of energy you know!Tell your family hello for me. We are all looking forward to seeing you guysat the pink house!Love you!Lisa",

Would the replacement energy from the market be obtained undercontracts of similar length and firmness as the QF contracts that the energyreplaces?  If not, why would the CPUC want to replace long-term, committedQF power with short-term firm energy?2.    Why would the CPUC want to replace long-term QF power over which ithas substantial regulatory leverage (through SRAC pricing) with marketenergy from sources over which it may have less control?3.    Are there 8,000 MWs of low-cost replacement energy available inCalifornia, or in the WSCC with firm transmission to California?  How steepis the supply curve for replacement energy?4.    After a QF is bought out, I assume that it would simply operate in theelectric market as a merchant plant, if it continues to operate to provideon-site power and thermal energy.  Is this correct?5.    How sensitive are your calculated ratepayer and QF benefits to changesin the relationship between SRAC (i.e. gas) and electric market prices?6.    Assuming that there are both ratepayer and QF benefits from QFcontract buyouts, why is there a need for a formalized auction process, whenthe same benefits might be captured through bilateral negotiations (such asthe QF buyouts done to date)?7.    Doesn't your proposal require the utilities to be back in the powerprocurement business?  If not, why not?As you perhaps can tell, my questions focus on whether now is the right timefor such a broad plan to buyout QF contracts.Talk to you tomorrow,Tom",

They are wanting to discuss completely different issues than PG&E   To date, PG&E issues have been focused around the outcome of the FERC refund case. I have worked through a couple of examples of this under collection issue with Jeff and we agree, Edison's  argument  that the DA load contributed to the under collection is \"technically\" correct.   We will have to work with Jeff to build a compelling argument that ESP's should not be required to continue to contribute to the under collection, especially as of March 31, 2002, the end of the rate freeze as required in AB 1890.   Somehow we have to convince \"the regulators\"  that the original intent of the de-reg bill, that utilities recover what they can through no later than March, 02,  stay in place for the current DA load.

Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?

        "Text": "I know that SCE is taking this position.  They are simple wrong.  Unless and until we get all of our \"positive\" CTC back from the Utility, why should I even begin to consider their \"goofy\" arguments.  In addition, SCE is receiving $3.3 B which is a full payment of all Negative CTC.  If their issue is to have a Undercollection charge against all customers, that's a different policy matter.  The CPUC agreed to the idea of Negative CTC and SCE needs to pay.  Also, if we are 5% of load and the Undercollection is $3.3 B, I think that SCE would be looking for $165 MM - our entire claim.  They aren't talking about 5% from our view $150 MM claim.Jim -----Original Message-----Sent:\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 6:18 PMTo:\tCurry, WandaCc:\tSteffes, James D.; Tribolet, MichaelNeed to think about it a bit.  Here's some of what we know based on the settlement:Total debt = 6.35 BAfter they contribute all cash on their books and agree to eat a little, the PUC is allowing them to collect somewhere between $3.0-3.3B--depends on who you talk to.The total owed to ESPs is $243 MM. -----Original Message-----Sent:\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 5:56 PMTo:\tDasovich, JeffCc:\tSteffes, James D.; Tribolet, MichaelJeff,Do we know how much Edison's total under collection is?  Would it be as simple as to determine their total (around $3 billion?) and  gross receivable (before any payments - 145 million) and calculate the % (around 5%)?  This would result in a pretty small percentage.  Another way to look at it would be on a % of load basis.  If you use the DA load information Sue forwarded to us on October 1st,   this % (5.7%)  would also be very small.  How do you think they will look at it?  I think we would all agree to a 5% haircut, if they would JUST PAY US!Wanda -----Original Message-----Sent:\tTuesday, October  23, 2001 5:19 PMTo:\tSteffes, James D.; Curry, Wanda; Tribolet, MichaelBest,Jeff -----Original Message-----Sent:\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 5:05 PMTo:\tDasovich, JeffJeff --How would we calculate EES' \"contribution\" to SCE undercollection?Jim -----Original Message-----Sent:\tTuesday, October 23, 2001 5:02 PMTo:\tShapiro, Richard; Steffes, James D.; Mellencamp, Lisa; Tribolet, Michael; Sanders, Richard B.; Kean, Steven J.; Sharp, Vicki; Smith, Mike; Williams, Robert C.; Curry, Wanda; Swain, Steve; Huddleson, Diann; Calger, Christopher F.; Belden, Tim; Dietrich, JanetI talked to John Fielder (SVP Edison) about setting up a meeting for Barry Tycholiz with Edison's CFO about hedging Edison's QF price risk. Fielder wanted to talk about the negative CTC issue. Here's what he said:They plan to \"settle\" with the ESPs and pay them when they pay everyone else, which he re-iterated would be sometime in Q1'02.Edison is holding firm to the notion that the negative CTC contributed to the utility's undercollection and that the ESP's share of the undercollection has to be netted against the payables attributable to the negative CTC and owed the ESP.In addition, he said that they have the view that a decision is going to have to be made about 1) whether DA customers pay for stranded costs tied to the DWR L-T contracts, and 2) whether DA customers pay going forward for stranded costs tied to the QF contracts.  (Edison is clearly lobbying the PUC to get DA customers to pay for these costs.)I recommended strongly that he de-link issues 1 and 2 above from the issue of paying us ASAP what they owe us for negative CTC.  He agreed.He said that the PUC judge's recently issued pre-hearing conference order requires that Edison \"meet and confer\" with ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th hearing, and that Edison intends to set something up with ESPs prior to that hearing.Fielder is also the point person on \"getting ESPs paid\" and intends to initiate settlement discussions with ESPs week after next.It was very clear from the conversation that Edison is going to do everything possible (at the expense of creditors) to maximize headroom under the settlement it struck with the PUC a few weeks ago.  Edison's stalemate with the QFs is evidence of it.  We shouldn't assume anything different with the Negative CTC issue.If you have any questions, let us know.Best,Jeff",

For example, in the current position report the largest volumes by far in Calif appear in the rate class labelled \"?\".Still, we have a total volume for 2002 of 8,331,762 MWH, or about 83% of the total reported.

        "Text": " FERC extends $1,000 price cap on NY ISO powerDow Jones InteractiveOctober 24, 2001  Dow Jones InteractiveOctober 24, 2001  Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second QuarterDow Jones InteractiveOctober 24, 2001          FERC extends $1,000 price cap on NY ISO power WASHINGTON, Oct 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on Wednesday agreed to extend a price cap of $1,000 per megawatt hour for wholesale electricity bids handled by the New York Independent System Operator. The New York ISO asked FERC to approve an extension through April 30, 2002, for the price cap, which first went into effect in July of last year. However, FERC said it expected power supplies in New York City and Long Island to remain tight through the summer of 2002. The ISO would likely request another bid cap extension at that time. Therefore, FERC said the price cap will last as an interim measure until the new Northeast Regional Transmission Organization is up and running. \"We believe that our decision ... will promote price certainty and market participants' confidence in the New York ISO-administered markets, which will increase supply, improve reliability and ... lower energy prices,\" the agency said in its order. The New York ISO operates one of the nation's biggest wholesale electric markets with billions of dollars in transactions. The $1,000 price cap was first adopted to control market manipulation and prevent artificially inflated prices. The cap is supported by several large utilities, such as Consolidated Edison Inc. , which were concerned about high wholesale power prices that occurred after the New York ISO took control of the state's power grid. FERC aims to create four huge Regional Transmission Organizations to replace the New York ISO and similar groups in managing the nation's power grid. Federal regulators see the RTOs as a way to avoid a repeat of the power crisis in California last winter, in which the antiquated U.S. grid prevented more power from flowing into the state. Under FERC's plan, the RTOs would be for-profit groups in the U.S. Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and West. Each region would combine public utility transmission facilities to provide open access, more reliable power and lower rates for consumers. However, some utilities have been hesitant to join an RTO because they will some lose control over the rates they charge other companies to use their power lines. USING scare and bully tactics, the federal government is trying to force Maryland electricity consumers into paying higher prices for less reliable service and less local control. That's the outlook for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's plan to create four new large regional power transmission groups to manage the nation's electric grid. The efficient, stable, economical PJM Interconnection grid system that's taken over 70 years to refine would be twisted and subverted to serve the needs of high-cost New York. Maryland's carefully crafted deregulation plan to benefit consumers and utilities is also threatened by the FERC order to create a Northeast regional transmission organization within three years. Challenges by Maryland, Virginia and Washington to the federal agency's mandate have been ignored. So have protests from Vermont and New Hampshire. Curiously, FERC cited the PJM network, which includes Maryland, as a model for the nation. Then it ordered a hasty merger of PJM with less able New York and New England systems. Warning of California -type energy problems for the rest of the nation, FERC has pressed its theory that bigger is always better. It ignores the fact that California is the largest U.S. electric market and still failed due to arrogant mismanagement. Some opposition to the FERC plan is based on loss of control by state regulators and existing regional systems. States opposed to deregulation fear the plan will force that change on them. Even within PJM, which serves five states and Washington, members hold differing positions on forming mega-regional networks. But PJM is the largest competitive wholesale power market in the world and has served its 22 million customers well. There's little benefit and a lot of risk in forcing it into a shotgun marriage with less capable Northeastern partners. Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.  ",

The report, which covered October 2001 through May 2002, projected that resources would cover expected load each month with the exception of May, when demand rises significantly as the region starts to heat up. \"Operating margins for May 2002 are slim with the current level of planned outages. However, the May peak generally occurs late in the month and planned outage levels usually decline significantly throughout the month,\" the report noted. The report also said that new generation should play a key role in helping to avert blackouts in May. \"It is expected that sufficient new generation will become available such that the projected deficiency for May 2002 can be avoided,\" the report said. An additional 1,612 megawatts is expected to be operational by the end of 2001. During 2002, an additional 6,490 MW of new generation capacity is expected to be added based on currently announced plans. \"This additional generation is in varying phases of development and it is uncertain how much of this new capacity will become available during the January through May 2002 period,\" the report said. Forecast peak load was seen mostly running slightly below an average covering 1998-2001. In December, for example, a peak load of 33,586 MW was projected versus an average of 33,937 MW, ISO figures show. Demand has been running below year earlier levels each month this year. \"The CAISO foresees that there will be some lasting effects due to conservation efforts, but anticipates that the magnitude of conservation may decrease over time,\" the report said. California, hit with a severe power shortage linked partly to a flawed law deregulating its electricity market, endured the year's sixth and so far last rolling blackout on May 8. The lights stayed on throughout the summer, when the threat of blackouts was seen to be greatest due to heavy use of power hungry air conditioning systems. Conservation and new power plants are believed to have played important roles in preventing blackouts.  Texas Ready For Jan 1 Start For Deregulation -Official  CHICAGO -(Dow Jones)- Texas will be ready to implement full-scale deregulation of the retail electricity business at the beginning of next year, despite challenges from critics, the top official at the state's power-grid operator said Monday . \"We believe that we've come a long way,\" said Tom Noel, chief executive officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. \"My confidence is very high that the Ercot system will be ready to go Jan. 1, 2002.\" A coalition of Texas consumer groups filed with the state's Public Utility Commission last week to urge a delay. A pilot program for 5% of Texas' investor-owned utility customers has been in effect since late July, and it started after a nearly two-month delay linked to system glitches. The consumer groups, including AARP and Consumers Union, the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports, want to delay the start of full competition until Ercot proves its systems are up to the task. The groups cited problems with switching customers from their utility to alternate suppliers, among other issues. \"It is in the best interests of consumers and the industry to be sure that when the market is open it is also functional,\" the groups said in comments filed with the PSC. But Noel said most glitches have been fixed or will be fixed in time to meet the Jan. 1 deadline. So far 11,952 of 78,825 customers that requested a switch to a new provider have been switched, and the others are moving through the planned 45-day switching process, he said. There was a backlog of customers waiting to switch in August, caused by system malfunctions, but those have mostly been resolved, he said. Ercot has had other trouble making sure its system gets customer information to the new power supplier, but it believes those systems will be fixed by mid November, Noel said. Noel also said Ercot's settlement system will become more accurate over time as more data is collected to provide better cost estimates. The settlement system calculates costs for large and small wholesale power customers and has been a source of dispute in the state. \"The market's working very well,\" Noel said. \"What we have is a data problem.\" Ercot's systems are designed to handle about 20,000 customer switches a day. So far, the system has received and processed a peak volume of between 10,000 and 15,000 switches, Noel said. -By Jon Kamp, Dow Jones Newswires; 312-750-4129; jon.kamp@dowjones.com  Calif Will Have Enough Power On Hand This Winter -Report LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California may be able to chill out a bit this winter. New power plants and continued conservation should give the state enough of a margin to head off the soaring prices and rolling blackouts that plagued it a year ago, according to a forecast released last week by the state's power grid operator \"In general, it looks like a pretty good forecast through the winter months into 2002,\" said Gregg Fishman, spokesman for the California Independent System Operator. Last winter, California experienced an unprecedented electricity shortage that resulted in more than 30 days of power emergencies and scattered rolling blackouts. The situation was partly due to the deteriorating financial condition of the state's two largest utilities, high prices of natural gas and maintenance outages. This winter, however, the state should have an adequate supply of electricity , due in part to new generation coming online and a statewide conservation effort. Power-plant maintenance will be minimal during the 2001-2002 winter season compared with last year, and new power plants operating since Sept. 30 will produce 2,231 megawatts in new supply, according to the ISO report. The ISO, charged with keeping power supply and demand in balance on the grid and operating the state's spot electricity market, expects demand for power to peak at 34,359 megawatts in October and about 32,000 megawatts from November through May. That would leave operating reserves of between 2,000 and 2,200 megawatts - roughly a 7% reserve margin - the minimum amount required by the Western Systems Coordinating Council, which maintains grid reliability throughout the West. The ISO said the reserve margin is enough to avert the disaster the state experienced last winter, according to the report. In addition, the ISO expects there will be enough natural gas in storage to meet demand. Last winter, the price of natural gas skyrocketed to $60 a million British thermal unit. Currently, the average price of natural gas is about $2/MMBtu. \"Natural-gas storage is looking very, very strong,\" Fishman said. \"There's far more in storage and available in general than we saw last year at this same time.\" The ISO doesn't know whether generators have firm fuel contracts in place to cover demand. But the grid operator doesn't expect limits on gas supplies to hurt its ability to keep the lights on, according to the report. The ISO forecast assumes Californians will continue to conserve about 12% of their electrical consumption, Fishman said. The state also relies heavily on imports from the Pacific Northwest in order to get through without any power emergencies or rolling blackouts. The state expects to import about 3,000 MW this winter. As a result, the ISO forecast could change in the coming months, if the state is unable to import power. Currently, the forecast for the Pacific Northwest calls for a wet winter in the Northwest, according to the National Weather Service. Jerry Rust, president of the Northwest Power Pool, told Dow Jones Newswires the region expects to cover peak demand this winter. The agency is currently preparing its own report, he added. New generation upgrades in northern California will help minimize congestion on the transmission link known as Path 15, the key north-south interconnection, although bottlenecks could still occur, according to the report. \"Depending on actual Pacific Northwest import levels and Northern California hydro levels, potential overloads on Path 15 could occur again this winter as a result of south-to-north power transfers,\" according to the report. Some areas of northern California , particularly Humboldt County and the Bay Area, could encounter some difficulties if local generation isn't available due to power plant maintenance or breakdowns. For 2002, the ISO said there are 40 new power plant projects totaling 6,490 megawatts that are in different phases of hooking up to the grid, but it's unclear how much of that capacity will be added before May 2002, according to the report.   CPUC Approves Transmission Project SAN FRANCISCO, California - The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) last week approved a transmission project to increase capacity to several cities in the San Francisco metropolitan area, that will be built by Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E). The 230-kilovolt transmission line would serve the cities of Dublin, Pleasanton, Livermore, San Ramon, and unincorporated areas of Alameda and Contra Costa counties. The CPUC placed a cap of $118 million on the project costs for the 8.8-mile line. As a condition for approval, the CPUC also required PG&E to remove an existing 60-kilovolt line.   WestConnect Established as Framework for Regional Transmission Organization TUCSON, Ariz.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 15, 2001--A broad group of electric transmission line owners in the Southwest has taken initial steps to form WestConnect, a for-profit regional transmission organization (RTO). Founding members believe WestConnect will form the framework for an RTO for the entire Western United States. Agreements and operating protocols for the RTO were filed today with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) by Arizona Public Service Co., El Paso Electric Co., Public Service Co. of New Mexico, and Tucson Electric Power Co., each of which is subject to FERC oversight. These utilities, along with Salt River Project in Arizona, have agreed to fund start-up of WestConnect operations, which are projected to begin in 2004. Other utilities in the Desert Southwest and adjoining areas have been actively involved in the process and are expected to continue to be involved as WestConnect gets underway. FERC has proposed RTOs to facilitate development and operation of transmission on a regional basis. WestConnect will strengthen reliability for customers and ease the transfer of electricity between regions. It will do so by focusing on transmission line reliability, non-discriminatory open access to use of the lines, support for a robust wholesale market, and governance that is independent of market participants. WestConnect evolved from an earlier Southwestern RTO development project named DesertSTAR, and it has used the operating protocols developed by DesertSTAR stakeholders through extensive negotiations during the last four years. DesertSTAR Chairman of the Board Jack King said, \"WestConnect is a logical step. I am encouraged by the actions of the WestConnect members in building upon the work of DesertSTAR to move toward an RTO for the West.\" The group turned to the for-profit governance structure, in lieu of the not-for-profit DesertSTAR model, in response to recent FERC rulings and a desire to create a governance structure that will encourage innovation and creativity in the operation and further development of the Western transmission grid. WestConnect has been structured to permit involvement by investor-owned utilities, cooperatives, public-power entities and federal power marketing agencies, so it can transition into the RTO for the West. WestConnect is working closely with other utility companies and provisional RTO projects to explore expanding WestConnect's service area. WestConnect utilities say they are confident their filing with FERC conforms to the regulatory agency's established organizational and operating guidelines.   ",

So while Edison is making good noises about wanting to settle (which is a certainly a step in the right direction), it's still unclear whether they intend to attach terms to the deal that make the whole thing a nonstarter.Got a call into John Fielder to try to get answers to some of these questions.Will report back when (and if) we get some answers.Best,Jeff -----Original Message-----Sent:\tMonday, October 29, 2001 5:27 PMTo:\tSteffes, James D.; Mara, Susan; Tribolet, Michael; Mellencamp, Lisa; Curry, Wanda; Williams, Robert C.; 'Mike Day (E-mail)'Cc:\tShapiro, Richard; Sanders, Richard B.; Sharp, VickiWith respect to past due PX credit amounts, Edison has told folks today that:Edison will distribute a one-pager by mid-day tomorrow laying out its proposal for how to handle payment of past due PX credit amounts.Edison is trying to meet individually with all ESPs prior to the Nov. 7th prehearing conference at the PUC to discuss and hopefully reach agreement with ESPs on its proposal.Edison hopes to make progress with the ESPs between now and the Nov. 7th prehearing conference, and if so, intends to tell the judge that the PUC should delay action on the complaints pending settlement.We'll distribute Edison's proposal as soon as we get it.Best,Jeff -----Original Message-----Sent:\tMonday, October 29, 2001 8:04 AMTo:\tDasovich, Jeff; Mara, Susan; Tribolet, Michael; Mellencamp, Lisa; Curry, Wanda; Williams, Robert C.; Mike Day (E-mail)Cc:\tShapiro, Richard; Sanders, Richard B.; Sharp, VickiSubject:\tProposed SCE Negotiation StrategyFollowing last week's meeting, here is my recommendation on how to proceed with SCE.1.\tForm Enron Negotiation Team\tMy recommendation is to use the same team we used with PG&E + Jeff Dasovich.

Edison'scomments on the proposed decision say that over 6% of their load hasswitched to direct access during the July 1 to September 6 time frame,resulting in a total of over 7% of load being served by direct access overtheir entire system at present.  While it appears Bilas is still a strongproponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing theDWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, shouldEnron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to preventany backsliding on the 13th.  We have a right to a meeting with Bilas.  Ameeting with Brown would have to be noticed today or be held only with hisadvisor, Dave Gamson. I would recommend we try for both.Mike Day",

While it appears Bilas is still a strongproponent of allowing direct access and should still advocate reducing theDWR contract commitements instead of restricting customer options, shouldEnron, or AReM get in to see Bilas (and possibly Brown) to try to preventany backsliding on the 13th.

        "Text": "Except that my understanding of the SCE model is that the CTC structure will continue beyond 3/31/02 (and may then apply for PG&E).  I agree that if you were to go to a bottom's up, it would require the CPUC to put in place a surcharge for remaining stranded costs (non-generation, for example QFs) and a second surcharge for Negative CTC \"overpayment\".  Key question is who will pay the Negative CTC \"overpayment\"?  On trying to understand the PX Credit algorithim, my concern is that to understand how much the \"overpayment\" was during Oct - Feb, we need to understand how costs hit the structure during that time period.  Otherwise we don't know what form or amount of discount is required in the Settlement talks.Jim -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 7:24 PMTo:\tSteffes, James D.After 3/31/02, the CTC should no longer be a function of the PX credit, no?  So a customer's CTC payments should not be affected by refunds. If refunds are distributed prospectively, we do not need to really know the PX credt algorithm and can instead simply estimate PG&E's expected refunds, divide it by total load, and assume that the PX credit will be depressed by that amount.  This is more akin to a lower shopping credit than a higher CTC. -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 4:32 PMTo:\tComnes, AlanAlan --The only way to collect the \"overpayment\" is to artificially reduce the PX Credit going forward to thereby allow for more CTC.Jim -----Original Message-----Sent:\tWednesday, November 14, 2001 6:15 PMTo:\tSteffes, James D.I am not sure I understand your second paragraph.

Gray Davis has started taking money from power providers seeking to do business with the state. The two $25,000 contributions came during a series of fund-raisers the governor held when he made a trip last month to the East Coast to view the damage at the World Trade Center and Pentagon. The Democratic governor, who has raised more than $30 million for his re- election campaign, has been criticized for taking money from groups that have interests before the administration. Yesterday, Davis defended the decision to take the money, saying the worst of the energy crisis is behind us. \"My concern was in not taking money from people who were actively selling us power during the difficult early months in 2001,\" he said of his decision in January to stop taking contributions from utilities and power companies. \"To my knowledge neither of those companies are active players in that process. \" But consumer advocate Harvey Rosenfield blasted Davis for accepting the money and said it should be returned. \"If it was dirty money before, it is even dirtier now,\" said Rosenfield, who heads the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. Davis is mistaken to think that the energy crisis is over, Rosenfield said. \"Tell that to the 20 million Californians who have seen their rates increase an average of 50 percent,\" he said. The two companies -- FPL Energy LLC and Caithness Energy LLC -- each gave $25,000 to Davis' campaign fund. Both contributors have proposed projects pending in California. Caithness Energy, a New York-based generator, is expected to file plans to build a power plant with the California Energy Commission later this month. The company wants to build a 560-megawatt natural gas fired plant in Riverside County. And subsidiaries of FPL Energy, a Florida generator that operates power plants across the country, are in negotiations with the state's new Power Authority to construct wind turbines in Southern California. The state would buy energy from the turbines and have the option to own them. In addition, Caithness and FPL are working together to building another power plant in Riverside County. That project was approved by the state's Energy Commission in March. Garry South, Davis' political adviser, said the campaign's position had not changed with regard to collecting money from energy interests. South said that the two companies had not been gouging the state and that the fact they had business pending with the state was irrelevant. \"It is not against the law to take money from a company that does business with the state,\" he said. South said the contributions had no bearing on any decisions made.   India Dabhol Project Due Diligence To Start Next Week NEW DELHI -(Dow Jones)- Prospective buyers of the 85% foreign equity in India's 2,184-megawatt Dabhol Power Co. will start due diligence of the project next week, A.K. Doda, executive director of Industrial Development Bank of India (P.IDB), told Dow Jones Newswires Friday. The possible buyers are Tata Power Co. Ltd. (P.TPW) and BSES Ltd. (P.BSX) \"After the due diligence is completed, price negotiations will start and thereafter, the transfer of shares and transfer of ownership will take place,\" Doda said. U.S. energy company Enron Corp. (ENE) has a controlling 65% equity stake in Dabhol and wants to sell it because of payment defaults by the plant's sole customer - the Maharashtra State Electricity Board - and the Indian federal government's failure to honor payment guarantees. In August the U.S. company said it was willing to sell its equity at cost. Dabhol is India's largest single foreign investment to date. MSEB has 15%, while U.S.-based companies General Electric Co. (GE) and Bechtel (X.BTL) own 10% each in DPC. \"The share price of the shareholding of Enron and its associates in DPC would be decided by the concerned parties, through mutual negotiations. Indian financial institutions propose to continue their efforts to ensure quick resolution of all issues at the earliest,\" Doda said. Doda denied local media reports saying that India's state-owned firm National Thermal Power Corp. (P.NTP) was also a potential buyer of the foreign equity in Dabhol. \"So far, I am aware of only two companies - Tata Power and BSES. NTPC haven't sent us any expression of interest yet for the Dabhol project,\" he said. Ontario mulls alternative to Hydro deregulation The planned deregulation of the $35-billion Ontario electricity sector has been thrown in doubt by a radical proposal that would shackle the province's electricity transmission company, preventing it from becoming a significant player in an open North American power market. The plan, known only to Ontario Premier Mike Harris and a few government and Bay Street insiders, would turn Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity instead of a fully commercial, privatized company. If this happens, Hydro One would lack the flexibility to raise equity capital, make acquisitions and form partnerships in an effort to become one of continent's premier transmission companies -- a goal plainly set out by chief executive officer Eleanor Clitheroe. David Lindsay, the president and chief executive officer of Ontario SuperBuild Corp., the government's privatization adviser, confirmed that turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization, similar to Nav Canada, the civil air navigation service, is under serious consideration. \"We've been asked to evaluate all options for Hydro One's future, including this one,\" he said yesterday. He would not provide details, though it is thought that the government wants to make a decision on Hydro One's future ownership structure by the conclusion of the year. A senior official in the Ontario government, who did not want to be identified, said the proposal \"is a step backward to the old days of Ontario Hydro.\" He was referring to the debt-laden utility that was split into Ontario Power Generation, the electricity generating arm, and Hydro One, whose network of high-voltage transmission lines spans 30,000 kilometres. The Premier's office would not comment. A spokeswoman for Energy Minister Jim Wilson would say only that \"there are a number of options on the table.\" Sources on Bay Street and at Queen's Park said the idea of turning Hydro One into a not-for-profit entity is being propelled by Anthony Fell, the chairman of Royal Bank-owned RBC Dominion Securities, Bay Street's largest dealer. If the new Hydro One took this shape, it would raise about $10-billion through the sale of bonds to investors. The dealers' commission on the sale of the bonds, which would rank among the biggest debt issues in history, would range from $25-million to $40-million, one Bay Street executive said. Mr. Harris is said to be keen on the concept partly because all the money would go back to the government to help pay down the $21-billion in \"stranded debt\" racked up by the old Ontario Hydro. The generating and transmission giant's decades-long spending spree on nuclear plants and other assets tore a huge hole in the province's balance sheet. Hydro One's cash flow, derived from sales to electricity users, would be used to pay the interest on the $10-billion of bonds. Presumably, consumers would face higher electricity charges if Hydro One lacked sufficient cash to pay the interest. If Hydro One were a private company instead, its financial risk would be borne by shareholders, not ratepayers. The United States has embraced deregulation partly because it shifts the financial risk of the electricity market from taxpayers to shareholders. Executives at RBC Dominion declined to comment on the plan, citing client confidentiality concerns. Mr. Fell first proposed it to the government in the spring. The government wants to open up the Ontario electricity market, in which buyers and sellers can negotiate prices, by next spring. The market overhaul contemplated turning Ontario Power Generation and Hydro One, both of which are 100 per cent owned by the government, into commercial companies. In Hydro One's case, the leading options were thought to be an outright sale, in which the utility would be bought by another company (presumably a rival utility), or an initial public offering, where the shares would be owned by private investors and traded on the stock exchange. The third option -- converting Hydro One into a not-for-profit organization -- has come as a surprise. There has been no debate on this option, though rumours of its existence have jolted Bay Street and Hydro One, both of which were working on the assumption that the transmission business would eventually become a commercial enterprise. Sources said that Hydro One management opposes the not-for-profit structure because it would deny Hydro One the flexibility and discipline of a typical commercial business. The not-for-profit structure would mean it would not have to pay taxes, which raises potential trade issues with the United States. American transmission companies might argue that Hydro One's non-taxable status gives it an unfair competitive advantage. It would also deny Hydro One management the benefit of potentially lucrative share options. Rod Taylor, Hydro One's executive vice-president, would not comment on the not-for-profit option being contemplated by the government. He said, however, that the company's strategy hinges on its ability to become a major player in the deregulated North American electricity market. \"Our vision of the company is to become a fully commercial entity, and become in the transmission sector what Canadian National is to the rail sector,\" he said in a phone interview. Stanley Hartt, the chairman of the Canadian office of Wall Street's Salomon Smith Barney, is among the Bay Street executives who opposes a not-for-profit structure for Hydro One (Salomon has a small role as an adviser to Hydro One's strategic business plan). In a three-page letter sent this week to the top executives of several large power-using Ontario companies, he said that \"this idea is short-sighted and bad for Ontario.\" He argued that \"the absence of an equity component in the capital structure of the not-for-profit corporation essentially transfers the equity risk to the ratepayers.\" He also said that, without financial flexibility, Hydro One would lack the resources to invest in \"new bottleneck-eliminating connections\" that would allow the company to become a significant electricity exporter. \"Ontario would lose the prospect of becoming a true hub for North American Energy transmission,\" he said. In a recent report on the power industry, TD Newcrest analyst David McCracken wrote, \"With its operating expertise and strong balance sheet, Hydro One is well positioned to act as a consolidator of transmission grids in the northern United States, where ownership tends to be fragmented.\" He noted that Hydro One is expected to be privatized in the next few years, and he said the utility has \"the opportunity to lever strengths from traditional wires businesses into competitive high-growth initiatives.\" According to sources familiar with the not-for-profit proposal, Hydro One would be governed in the best interests of all electricity users by stocking the board of directors with appointees from corporations that are heavy power users, such as auto and steel makers and paper companies. Such a structure exists at Nav Canada, with airline executives on the board, and the company has been able to cut the fees it charges customers. Restructuring Hydro One with debt, rather than equity, is also presented as the most efficient way to capitalize the company. \"The problem with a Canadian National Rail-style IPO is that equity is much more expensive than debt,\" said one financier familiar with the proposal. \"With a debt-based structure, every dollar earned is available to pay interest, while an equity-based structure means you pay federal taxes, provide a return to shareholders and make debt payments.\" Dofasco Inc., the big Ontario steel producer that consumes about $100-million of electricity a year, supports the not-for-profit proposal. Gord Forstner, head of communications, said a bond sale would reduce Ontario Hydro's stranded debt by $10-billion immediately, paving the way for lower electricity charges. Currently, a special levy on all electricity bills is being used to whittle down the debt. The charge costs Dofasco alone about $15-million a year. \"We want to see the stranded debt paid down first,\" Mr. Forstner said. \"Until that happens, we don't favour Hydro One going to the expense of expanding outside of Ontario's boundaries.\" Hydro One at a glance Ontario's electricity transmission system split off from the former Ontario Hydro in May, 2000. It is the largest power distribution network in Canada and serves 1.2 million people. ",

Pushing for public power / Backers say they'll have issue on next ballotPublic power advocates in San Francisco will have to convince people like Tim Colen that their idea is a good one if they want to go back to the ballot next year and win. Colen, who lives in the West Portal area, voted against two measures on the Nov. 6 ballot that would have paved the way for a public power system in San Francisco and ended PG&E's monopoly in the local energy market. The company and other corporate interests spent more than $2 million to defeat the effort. Colen's vote reflected the sentiment throughout the city's conservative strongholds -- among them West Portal and other West of Twin Peaks neighborhoods -- and in the wealthier pockets of Pacific Heights and Sea Cliff. In those neighborhoods, Proposition F and Measure I lost almost 2 to 1. In the city's more liberal neighborhoods -- Haight-Ashbury, Bernal Heights, South of Market and Noe Valley -- the reverse was true. And in the Mission, support for public power was almost 3 to 1. \"Those were the districts that were focused on because of limited resources,\" said Board of Supervisors President Tom Ammiano, a public power booster. \"Once we engaged people, talked to them, they were very responsive. I think the same thing would have to happen in the other districts when we go forward again.\" For Colen, an environmental geologist and consultant, the proposals were poorly drafted, more intent to take a whack at the corporate giant PG&E than to make sure that electricity is delivered to city residents and businesses at a lower cost and more reliably -- as backers of the measures promised. \"San Francisco can get into the energy business,\" said Colen. \"But it should be incremental, with a sound policy, and with people in charge who are experts.\" In addition, he doesn't want an elected board running the operation, as both Measure I and Proposition F required, and he wants the city to explore working with PG&E instead of ousting the private utility competely. Then, Colen said, he may support public power. Proposition F called for replacing the city's existing water and power department with a new, expanded agency to deliver publicly owned electricity to consumers. It lost by 533 votes, or less than 1 percentage point. Measure I, the more far-reaching of the two, lost by 4,361 votes, or 3.5 percentage points. It would have set up a municipal utilities district in San Francisco and neighboring Brisbane. It made a target of PG&E but also had the power to take over the garbage, cable and phone operations. Despite the loss, supporters of municipal power expect to resurrect the idea. Ammiano and other backers are exploring how far the city can go to begin public power without voter approval. At the same time, they are considering a way to put the issue before voters again next year. Bob Lipman, a retiree who lives in Cow Hollow, voted against the two ballot proposals two weeks ago. His chief concern was the lack of documentation detailing the cost of creating a new public power system. \"It was a blank check,\" he said. He also wanted more than a promise that rates would go down. Supervisor Tony Hall, the West of Twin Peaks representative who opposed the ballot measures, agreed that with more hard facts his constituents might buy into public power if the findings tilted in favor of sound fiscal policy. \"People want to know how much this is going to cost,\" Hall said. Ammiano, the author of Proposition F, said he expected the city to conduct feasibility studies that outline costs, generation capabilities, financing options and the benefits and disadvantages of various public power scenarios. \"While I believe we made a strong case for a municipal water and power agency, I think we can take the time between now and next November to provide further study on the issue, explain to voters exactly why public power will work in San Francisco and expand the coalition to include consumer interests, business owners and property owners backing the idea,\" Ammiano said. Another factor, he said, is voter turnout. \"If we had 1 percent higher turnout we probably would have won,\" Ammiano said. For example, several neighborhoods -- among them the Western Addition, Civic Center and the South of Market -- had turnout lower than the citywide average, which was just less than 30 percent. Supervisor Chris Daly said the key to win was turning out liberal voters -- not putting efforts into wooing conservatives. \"I truly believe I don't have to change people's minds,\" said Daly, who favors local control of the electrical system. \"I represent the majority opinion. But the majority doesn't necessarily come out to vote. That's what we have to work on.\"  PG&E CLEANING CONTAMINATED MARTINEZ SITE  - TWO FAMILIES LIVING ADJACENT TO THE SITE HAVE FILED CLAIMS AGAINST THE UTILITY, BLAMING POLLUTION FOR ILLNESSES AND DEATHS MARTINEZ -- PG&E crews have begun cleaning up the site of a former substation in Martinez, which had high levels of arsenic and lead in the soil. Crews will begin cleaning up two adjacent properties after the Thanksgiving weekend. The adjacent property owners and their families blame the contaminants for the illnesses and deaths of family members and filed a claim against Pacific Gas & Electric in bankruptcy court. The substation cleanup should be completed by mid-December at a cost of $225,000, said PG&E spokesman Jason Alderman. Cleaning up Tom Billecci's and Vince Aiello's properties will cost about $64,000. Once the substation site is free of contaminants, the utility will sell the property to a developer, who plans to build apartments. The cost of the cleanup is significantly more than the utility will make selling the property, Alderman said. \"The reason it's expensive is that this is the gold standard of how an environmental cleanup should be done,\" he said. The utility operated a substation at the site from 1910 to 1990. The Billecci and Aiello families have been in discussions with PG&E about the cleanup for a year. They claim that the contaminants contributed to family illness including cancer, asthma and skin disorders. The utility will remove soil on both properties and test the ground to make sure it is free of high levels of lead and arsenic. Contra Costa Health Services Hazardous Materials Program will oversee the cleanup. PG&E will clean the area around a shed on Billecci's property, something it had not planned to do before. Billecci said he is pleased that PG&E agreed to increase the scope of the cleanup Reliant to slash rates 17 % when deregulation beginsResidential customers who stick with Reliant Energy when electricity deregulation begins in January could see a drop in power rates of about 17 percent. That's according to figures filed Friday by Reliant with the Texas Public Utility Commission. Under the new so-called price-to-beat rate - which still needs PUC approval - someone using an average of 1,200 kilowatt-hours a month could save $257 over the course of a year, while someone using an average of 2,000 kilowatt-hours a month could save $426 annually. The big drop is being propelled significantly by lower natural gas prices. Consumers saw two electricity increases in the latter half of 2000 and another this year because natural gas prices had climbed. This year's increase, though, was rescinded as gas prices came down. The rate Reliant offers residential consumers and certain small businesses come Jan. 1 - when Texas opens its electricity market to competition - is known as the \"price to beat.\" Larger consumers can negotiate contracts with providers. The price to beat will serve as a benchmark for other competitors, which in turn are expected to offer lower rates. Other incumbent electric companies, including Dallas-based TXU Energy, will charge their own price-to-beat rates in their service territories. The PUC wants the price to beat low enough so consumers benefit from deregulation, but high enough so competitors can offer lower rates but make enough profit to stay in the market. Consumer groups have said the PUC is paying too much attention to competitors' profits and not enough to ensuring consumers get the lowest prices. Under the deregulation law, consumers automatically get a 6 percent cut in the base portion starting Jan. 1, which, depending on usage, can make up 60 percent of a consumer's costs. The PUC and Reliant have been trying to agree on the so-called fuel-factor portion of the price to beat. The figure Reliant filed Friday was to agreed to by the PUC staff and the company. The three-member commission still must give its approval, which it could do Tuesday or at a Dec. 3 meeting. The current rate for a residential Reliant customer who uses 14,400 kilowatt-hours of electricity in a year - or an average of 1,200 a month - is 10.42 cents per kilowatt-hour. Under the numbers Reliant filed Friday, the cost would be 8.64 cents per kilowatt-hour. That's a drop of 17 percent. Those per kilowatt-hour figures are calculated to take into account that customers use more electricity in the summer when prices are higher. Reliant charges different rates for summer and non- summer months and will keep doing so after deregulation begins. The per kilowatt-hour comparisons compiled for the PUC are annualized, average rates. All providers will break their electricity offers into similar rates so consumers will have an apples-to-apples way to compare them. Reliant and other existing companies are prohibited from cutting the base-rate portion of the price to beat for three years or until they lose 40 percent of their customers. The price to beat can be adjusted twice a year for fuel costs. Earlier this week, consumer groups said they were worried that an option being considered by the PUC, if adopted, could artificially raise the price to beat and cause residential consumers to pick up costs that should be borne by larger customers. That option, which involves fuel costs that utilities are still owed, isn't included in Reliant's filing. A PUC spokesman said one commissioner simply wanted more information about the idea, and it's unknown whether the PUC will ever take an up-or-down vote. Competitors of Reliant and other existing companies are obviously interested in what the price to beat will be. In a filing Thursday with the PUC, the New Power Co., which is offering residential service in Houston and elsewhere, said the price to beat will ultimately determine if deregulation succeeds in Texas. Because there was a sufficient difference between current prices and rates offered by competitors during a pilot test of deregulation, a relatively high number of consumers signed up for new providers during the program, New Power said. \"New Power is optimistic that the Texas market will support vigorous competition, but, like everyone else, we will have to wait and see how the future unfolds,\" it said.",

The stock is traded under the ticker symbol \"ENE.\" Visit Enron Direct's website at www.enrondirect.com <http://www.enrondirect.com>.   NEW YORK -(Dow Jones)- \"Noah's Ark\" should be the name of the company that emerges from the planned combination of Enron Corp. (ENE) and Dynegy Inc. (DYN), according to energy markets lore these days. After all, the logic goes, there will be two of everyone. Enron traders aren't so sure of that, as energy firms can attest. \"In the past 60 days, the number of resumes from Enron personnel has increased substantially,\" said William Begley, head of the energy and utilities practice at Heidrick & Struggles (HSII), an executive recruiting firm in Houston. Resumes are coming from all units at Enron, but the number of those from traders has grown significantly during the period, he added. Other recruiting firms said that Enron traders have become more receptive to unsolicitied headhunting calls lately. No one knows for sure how jobs will shake out at Enron, as the company goes through hard times and faces a merger with Dynegy. Recruiters and Enron employees are mixed over how much actual fallout there will be. One thing they agree on, though, is that if Enron traders do leave, they aren't guaranteed to find new jobs quickly despite their credentials -- which are regarded as sterling in the energy industry. If energy markets contract as a result of Enron's troubles, the job market for traders could flood. Dynegy plans to acquire Enron in a stock swap currently valued at $10.12 billion. The companies confirmed the deal late last week. Shares in both companies rose in heavy trading Monday as investors weighed the planned deal. Some uncertainty remains around the fate of the merger, partly because of the numerous regulatory hurdles it faces. Enron, still the largest energy trading company in the world, has suffered a massive setback in the past month. Four weeks ago, a $1.2 billion reduction of shareholder equity kicked off a slide in the company's share price, and prompted a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. Recruiters started seeing more resumes from Enron before the company's troubles came to a head. As early as this summer when former Enron executive Jeffrey Skilling left the company, employees at the company's non-core units have been looking for jobs, recruiters said. Electricity and natural gas traders at Enron have long been considered some of the smartest participants in U.S. energy markets. The company is a market maker in both gas and electricity, meaning that its prices for both commodities are benchmarks for traders throughout the markets. Enron led the effort to deregulate U.S. power markets, and has been one of the most vocal lobbyists for deregulation at the state and federal levels over the years. \"Because Enron is such a large counterparty in the energy trading sector, all of its trading partners, everyone, is hoping the thing gets resolved,\" said Bruce Peterson, managing director at Korn/Ferry Intl (KFY) in Houston, an executive search company. \"The whole industry is definitely affected by what has happened at Enron. Until it's sorted out, you have a tremendous amount of uneasiness. It needs to get resolved.\" It will be essential for Dynegy to keep some of the core leadership from Enron, analysts say. By retaining the best, Dynegy should be able to secure other strong Enron employees. \"In our view, Enron's energy trading and marketing personnel are arguably the most talented and definitely the most profitable group in the industry,\" Prudential Securities analyst M. Carol Coale said in a research note Monday. \"We believe that Dynegy must focus on retaining these valuable traders and marketers if the new company is to realize its full potential in the wholesale segment.\" Enron President and Chief Operating Officer Greg Whalley, who will be at Dynegy after the merger as an executive vice president, said in a conference call on Monday that he believes the new company will retain its traders. \"Most traders want to be part of the winning team,\" he said. Some recruiters believe that although many Enron employees are floating resumes, there won't be much actual fallout. Enron's trading operation employs between 1,000 and 1,500 people in North America; Dynegy's operation is staffed by 300. \"But with a few trimmings here and there you won't see a lot of Enron traders on the street, unless they don't like what they hear from Dynegy,\" said Jack Carr managing director of Prime Energy Partnership, a search and recruiting company based in the UK, with an office in Greenwich, Connecticut. An experienced energy trader with four years of experience can earn $125,000-$150,000 plus a bonus, according to Carr. Right now, Enron traders are feeling disappointed and confused, according to one trader at another company who wouldn't allow his name to be used. \"I think they're very nervous,\" the trader said. \"The Enron people think they're better than the Dynegy people, and the Dynegy people think 'we're buying them, so we can just pick through their stuff.'\"  Media to get access to state power pactsA coalition of news organizations settled with the governor's office on the only remaining issue in a lawsuit seeking access to the state's contracts with power generators. The settlement will require the state to release short-term and spot-market energy contracts within 47 days of the end of each contract period. \"It's not as soon as we wanted, but it's not the lengthy delay the governor wanted. It's somewhere in between,\" said Alonzo Wickers, the attorney for the news organizations. Spot-market contracts are agreements for 90 days or less, and short-term contracts last 91 days to a year. The legal battle began in February, when a handful of news organizations, including The San Diego Union-Tribune, sued Gov. Gray Davis to get information about the contracts under the California Public Records Act. Davis' spokesman could not be reached for comment yesterday. In June, a Superior Court judge ordered the state to release its long-term contracts, which revealed that the contracts the governor negotiated had bound the state to huge electricity costs through the end of the decade. \"All the self-congratulatory proclamations from the governor's office about how beneficial these contracts were for the state of California didn't pan out,\" Wickers said. \"It certainly seems the public had a right to know.\" State energy spending plunges Water official trumpets decline as cost control Sacramento -- The state's spending on energy plummeted in October to its lowest level this year, according to figures released yesterday by the Department of Water Resources. California spent $415 million on power purchases in October, half of what it spent in August and $264 million less than in September. Since January, the state has been purchasing power for the three investor- owned utilities. At the market's peak, the cost of power was an average of $65 million a day. October's average was $13.4 million a day. \"These steep declines in our overall power expenses are an obvious signal that California has accomplished the task of controlling what were once runaway costs in the spot market,\" said Pete Garris, acting deputy director of the Department of Water Resources, which is in charge of buying the state's power. \"Each month since May, California has been able to slash hundreds of millions of dollars off its costs,\" Garris said. \"These overall costs are a good measure of how successful we've been in lowering the price of energy.\" However, the department said it did not have figures for how much power the state sold last month. Without those numbers, consumer advocates say, it is impossible to know how well the state is doing. \"We need to know the entire picture,\" said Nettie Hoge, executive director of The Utility Reform Network. \"If we bought too much and are selling it at a loss, we need to know that.\" Hoge said this is especially important as the state begins to try to renegotiate long-term power contracts. Gov. Gray Davis and his administration began negotiating and signing long- term contracts during the height of the energy crisis. Davis and others say the contracts helped drive down the price of power, but critics say the state locked in too much power at too high a price. For the three months ending in June, the state sold about $25 million worth of power, at times even giving electricity away. \"We may need to take a broader look at the contracts,\" Hoge said. \"The downturn in natural gas prices has made a huge difference.\" That's because much of the electricity on the market is produced by plants that run on natural gas. Although the Davis administration has said it is open to renegotiating the contracts, it has made no progress thus far. A spokesman for the department said numbers detailing how much power the state has sold will be available later this month. ",

There are still fantasy issues that EPA and others are thinking about, which if implemented, will  make some of the ERC deals we have at best uneconomical. 2.    If we got this \"gift\", it would be nice to be able to sell the ERCs we have so that we can reduce our out of pocket exposure during these fun times.  Frankly, if Leslie's idea became law, these ERCs could be sold to projects who did not have access to the waste water that we do, thus facilitating additional new power plant devleopment for the benefit of the state. Having said all of the above, I have my doubts that something like this would have a chance of working out.  The little people in the environmental community have absolutely no concept of the big picture, being instead more worried about detail process over global results.  I think that this thing would get bogged down in the reality that projects would get ERCs, but the net result would be a short term decrease in air quality in the local air basin due to not applying specific, coincident ERCs to specific projects.  The little people probably cannot get their head around that, even though the very clean modern plants one day would put out of business dirtier, less efficient plants, thus resulting in a net improvement in air quality in the state.",

If the Commission does not impose a strict DASR cut off, it shouldrequire that any ESP which wishes to have a DASR processed after the cut offto submit their account specific DASR information and ESP contract to theCommission along with an explanation of why the customer is eligible toreceive DA.  The UDC will not process the DASR until it receives an okayfrom the Commission.3.  The ESP certifies through an affidavit that a particular DASR wasassociated with a contract in existence on September 20, 2001 (the UDCs setforth a proposed affidavit.)

Parties have until,Wednesday, November 28th, to comment.The following are proposed implementation rules for which the UDCs seekCommission approval:1.  A  DASR can only be processed if the customer name appears on the ESPList submitted to the UDCs on October 5, 2001.2. In order to submit an ESP List the ESP must have a valid ESP/UDC ServiceAgreement as of September 20, 2001 and , for ESPs serving small customers,they must have in effect a valid Commission registration as of September 20,2001.3. For a DASR to be processed for a residential or small commercial customeraccount, the ESP must be able to demonstrate that the required third partyverification took place prior to September 20, 2001.4.  Customers should not be allowed to switch from one ESP to another afterSeptember 20 unless the new ESP had a valid ESP- customer contract in placeon or before Sept. 20th.5.  Seamless moves within a UDC's service territory will be allowed.6.

I will write this letter and ifyou accept my request, I would send you ten-personalized copies (one foreach school that I am applying to) for you signatures.  That's all!

We want to option that tract so it could be used as constructionlaydown,   and more importantly to control the parcel across from the plantsite.  The   plan would be to buy the tract, but let him have rights to farmingit -   once we're done using it for laydown.  This gives us a buffer tractfor   sound mitigation etc. as well.   \"Gershon, Mark A. - CHI\" <Mark.Gershon@piperrudnick.com> on10/04/2000   04:09:26 PM         \"'fred.mitro@enron.com'\" <fred.mitro@enron.com>, \"Way, KarenS. -         CHI\" <karen.way@piperrudnick.com>   Titan Land Development Co., L.L.C.  holds the options on the  3properties   in Livingston County. If  you were to acquire those properties anddevelop   the Facility it is my understanding that Titan would be the entitythat   would be the owner of the Property and the Facility.  The proposed   Conditions were drafted to apply to the party defined as the \"Owner\"and   not   specifically to Titan or ENA.  Proposed Condition No. 12 providesthat:             The Special Use approved by this ordinance and all of the   conditions, obligations and rights provided for herein shall runwith the   ownership of the land and the Facility.  For purposes of thisSpecial Use,   \"Owner\" shall include the owner of the Property and the owner and/or   operator of the Facility.   Therefore, the conditions of the Special Use, including theobligation to   make the Escrow payment, should not apply to Titan until acquisitionof the   Property or development of the Facility.  In the unlikely scenariothat   Titan was to acquire the Property but not develop it, failure tosatisfy   the   Conditions should only relate to the right to use the Property forthe   Facility.  I am working with the County to get a copy of the final   ordinance   or resolution (they have not completed it yet) to confirm that it is   consistent with this proposal.

Thanks,Kay---------------------- Forwarded by Kay Mann/Corp/Enron on 12/01/2000 09:37 AM ---------------------------Carlos.Sole@enron.com on 12/01/2000 09:36:10 AMMichelle, per my voicemail as I indicated, I am trying to pursue whatopportunities may be available at EWS and both Julia Murray and Kay Mannrecommended that I contact you.  As background, I have been at EECC sinceOctober last year where I have focused on traditional EPC contracts andjoint venture agreements with construction partners, cross-border financingagreements principally in Mexico and merger and acquisition/strategicinvestment transactions.  Before coming to Enron, I worked with the Houstonoffice of a New York based firm (Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt & Mosle)where I focused mostly on transactions in Mexico since we represented Pemexon their transactions involving long and short term oil supply agreementsand CFE (Mexico's electricity commission) on its public bids for EPC andIPP projects.  Lastly, I started my legal career in 1994 at Patton Boggs inWashington, DC where I focused on general domestic corporate transactionssuch as establishing new business entities (ie, joint venture work,partnerships etc.), m & a work, and securities offerings.  Thanks for yourconsideration and I look forward to talking with you when you return fromvacation (my extension is 6-6127). - EECC Resume.doc",

I have been trying to get Enron interested in this technology for many years.  I am glad someone found the right formula.  I would like to discuss applications of Fuel Cell technology and where Enron intends to take this product with someone in your organization.  The press release did not disclose who the lead promoter in your organization is.  Can you direct me to the right person?Best regards,Marion Cole",

Thecontract will likely be a Connecticut law contract.  Could you have someonegive it a fatal flaw check, or should I use Connecticut counsel?One issue which is nagging me is their request for a security interest inthe equipment, as I think this might complicate financing.  I assume thatan equipment supplier has certain lien rights under Connecticut law anyway.Can you have this verified?

Per our discussion, Wes C.  suggested that we push the $2.0MM additional write down as well as the $7.1 turbine purchase revenue to Q4.1. Finding a buyer for either the LIPA PPA/Barges together, or just the barges by themselves2. Discussing with LIPA, the Power Desk, and BargeCo to find an acceptable PPA structure and barge price to meet our risk/return criteria.The decision tree for the LIPA deal is as follows:risk (discussions ongoing)replacement capacity charged by the desk.OR,PPA (ConEd, Montauk, NRG) ENA will purchase the barges from BargeCo (Barges are currently located in Brooklyn)  We will not purchase the barges and will shut down the LIPA deal.    to stop working on the deal.originally stated by BargeCo.  Additional capital investment would be required to meet our performance requirements - our position is that this additional cost must be borne by BargeCo.  We do not, however, want to implement this action until we have sold the 6B turbines to Enron Nigeria so that we are sure this transaction is completed.David W Delainey09/29/2000 08:25 AMGuys, what are we going to do with this contract and the barges?
